# Quickstart

Keel is a purpose-built backend that **heavily accelerates product development** by providing powerful tooling to build and manage your product. In this guide, we will setup and use those tools, ultimately deploying our product to Keel.

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, you'll need to have the following installed:

1. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
2. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

### Optional Prerequisites

Since Keel applications are described in a custom schema language, we have a [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=teamkeel.keel) to get syntax highlighting and autocompletion. If you're using VSCode, we highly recommend installing this extension.

## The CLI

To get the most out of Keel, you'll need the [Keel CLI](/cli) that can be installed by running the following command in your terminal:

```sh
$ npm install --global keel
```

This CLI will set you up with everything you need to run Keel locally before deploying to production.

## Creating a New Project

Great! Now that we have the CLI installed, let's create a new project by creating a directory where we can work. We'll call this directory `my-project`:

```sh
mkdir my-project
cd my-project
```

Now that we have a directory, we can create a new Keel project by running the following command:

```sh
keel init
```

This will create a few files for us, specifically:

- `schema.keel` - The file that represents our application's backend.
- `keelconfig.yaml` - Configuration for our backend around secrets, authentication, and more. We'll cover this in more detail later.

Great, we've got a Keel schema. Let's populate it.

## The Keel Schema

The Keel schema is a custom language that describes your application's backend. It's a declarative language that allows you to describe your application's data models, actions your application can do on those models, authentication, and more.

Let's explore this by creating a simple application that allows users to create and view posts.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  We've created an AI assistant called [KeelGPT](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-0xwNB1Azt-keelgpt) to help you navigate the Keel schema. It can generate schemas for you, answer questions, and more. It may be helpful as you follow the schema below.
</Callout>

Paste this into your `schema.keel` file:

```keel
// We define a model
model User {

    // A model has fields
    fields {
        identity Identity @unique
        name Text
        email Text
        posts Post[]
    }

    // A model also has actions which can be used via APIs
    actions {

        // Create a new user, setting the identity to the caller of the action
        create createUser() with (name, email) {
            @set(user.identity = ctx.identity)
        }

        // Get a single user
        get getUser(id) 

        // Get a list
        list listUsers()
    }

    // We also must define permissions for our model,
    // otherwise it will be inaccessible by default.
    @permission(
        actions: [get, list, create],
        expression: ctx.isAuthenticated
    )
}

// Let's repeat this for Posts
model Post {
    fields {
        title Text
        content Text
        author User
    }

    actions {
        create createPost() with (title, content, author.id) {
            @permission(expression: ctx.isAuthenticated)
        }
        get getPost(id)
        list listPosts(author.id?) 
    }

    @permission(
        actions: [get, list],
        expression: ctx.isAuthenticated
    )
}
```

From the above snippet, we get our first taste of the Keel schema language. Let's break it down.

### Models

Models are the core of your application. They represent the data that your application stores and manipulates. Models have `fields` that describe attributes about them, and `actions` that describe what you can do to them.

Models are locked down by default, meaning that you must explicitly define permissions for them to be accessible. We'll cover permissions in more detail later.

### Fields

Fields are the attributes of your models. They can be of a variety of types, including `Text`, `Number`, `Timestamp`, `Boolean`, and more. You can also define relationships between models, like `User` and `Post` above.

### Actions

Actions are the operations you can do on your models. They can be `create`, `get`, `list`, `update`, and `delete`. You can also define custom actions that can do anything you want. We'll dive into those later in the docs. For now, let's focus on the built-in actions that represent CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

### Permissions

Permissions are how you control access to your models and actions. They are defined using a custom expression language that allows you to define complex rules around who can access what. We'll cover this in more detail later.

## Running Locally

Now that we have a schema, let's run it locally. To do this, we'll need to start the Keel server. We can do this by running the following command:

```sh
keel run
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  You'll need to have Docker running for this to work. You can confirm this by running `docker ps` in your terminal.
</Callout>

This will start the Keel server locally, which will allow us to interact with our backend. It will give us 3 APIs: 

- A GraphQL API at http://localhost:8000/api/graphql
- A JSON API at http://localhost:8000/api/json
- A JSON RPC API at http://localhost:8000/api/rpc

Each API has feature parity, so you can use whichever you prefer. For this guide, we'll use the GraphQL API. You also get a GraphQL API playground at http://localhost:8000/api/graphiql.

That's it! Our backend is up and running! Let's interact with it using the GraphQL playground.


## Interacting with the GraphQL API

Let's start by authenticating with the API so we can create a user. To do this, let's first navigate to the GraphQL playground by going to http://localhost:8000/api/graphiql. From there, we'll need to run the following query:

```graphql
mutation authenticate {
# We're calling the authenticate mutation
  authenticate(
    # It takes an `input` argument
    input: {
        # We're authenticating with an email and password
        createIfNotExists: true, 
        emailPassword: {
            email: "test@keel.xyz",
            password: "superSecr3t!"
        }
    }
  ) {
    # We get back 
    token # an authentication token
    identityCreated # whether or not the identity was created
  }
}
```

If all went well, we should receive a response that looks something like this:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "authenticate": {
      "identityCreated": true,
      "token": "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJrZWVsIiwic3ViIjoiMll0ckZPdnFjQmQyZzFKRFQzOE9WQW9qWmMxIiwiZXhwIjoxNzAxNDQyMDEyLCJpYXQiOjE3MDEzNTU2MTJ9.bFBsXXJIaVy4ELRKInBKKQoFEVtAwJ1DUNH9oCwo0aT-5r5lQA6kEXJUrDK35Ini-0rKJfahwz-FcOQ6uLToIxuvoWeTtCLvVjEeBVcJWvpEASxXfntnIvn3oZBOhR8icExbPecbKE0dMmxRxvWmrjr3XDD9gUeWpj1MO4ihCgCszHRFJRjcMdy-3QzQ81LZXn0_SeXVpMgdfKIx7HLR95B2mnQi45isNreg9_lpzpXNIzH6r6YAmgamEmZIBts7e908VI2GeMEgB_ebgr2nN5s9R7X1rOSuXs31dB7LBsJgf2xYJ8KkF8O4SUV3rVZl1smJeBUsuMS6aWvy6cnwkQ"
    }
  }
}
```

That `token` is what will let us use the rest of the API.

Great! Now we have an [**Identity**](/identity). Let's use it to create `User` from our data model at the application level. To do this, we'll run the following query:

```graphql
mutation createUser {
    # We're calling the createUser mutation, generated by Keel with the appropriate inputs
  createUser(input: {
    name: "Testy McTesterson", 
    email: "test@keel.xyz"
}) {
    id # We get back an ID
  }
}
```

It's important that we're authenticated here, so let's take the `token` from the previous `authenticate` function and add it to the Headers tab in the GraphQL playground:

```json
{
  "Authorization":"Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJrZWVsIiwic3ViIjoiMll0ckZPdnFjQmQyZzFKRFQzOE9WQW9qWmMxIiwiZXhwIjoxNzAxNDQyMDEyLCJpYXQiOjE3MDEzNTU2MTJ9.bFBsXXJIaVy4ELRKInBKKQoFEVtAwJ1DUNH9oCwo0aT-5r5lQA6kEXJUrDK35Ini-0rKJfahwz-FcOQ6uLToIxuvoWeTtCLvVjEeBVcJWvpEASxXfntnIvn3oZBOhR8icExbPecbKE0dMmxRxvWmrjr3XDD9gUeWpj1MO4ihCgCszHRFJRjcMdy-3QzQ81LZXn0_SeXVpMgdfKIx7HLR95B2mnQi45isNreg9_lpzpXNIzH6r6YAmgamEmZIBts7e908VI2GeMEgB_ebgr2nN5s9R7X1rOSuXs31dB7LBsJgf2xYJ8KkF8O4SUV3rVZl1smJeBUsuMS6aWvy6cnwkQ"
}
```

Great. Now, if we run this mutation, we should receive a response like this:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "createUser": {
      "id": "2YtrRyJZjwm5KMzY1fYcK3BcYQ7"
    }
  }
}
```

We've created a user! The rest of the GraphQL API works similarly, so we won't go into detail here. You can explore the API using the GraphQL playground. 

Now, you've got a backend running locally—all that's left is to build a frontend that communicates with this API and we've got a full product.

## Deploying to Production

Now that we have a product running locally, let's deploy it to production. To do this, we'll need to create a Keel account. If you don't already have one, you can create one by navigating to [the Keel console](https://console.keel.so/) and signing up.

Then, we create a project on Keel, connect it to a GitHub repository hosting our code, and that's it—we're in production. Our local Keel backend is normally available at `http://localhost:8000/api/graphql`, but when we deploy to production, it will be available at `https://<project-name>.keel.so/api/graphql`. We can make customize which version our frontend talks to using [environment variables](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables#:~:text=Environment%20Variables%20are%20key%2Dvalue,Step%20or%20during%20Function%20execution.) and we're good to go.

This is how Keel **drastically accelerates product development** by providing powerful tooling and ideal developer experience for product backends end-to-end. We can build our product locally, and when we're ready, we can deploy it to production with a single command. We don't need to worry about infrastructure, databases, or anything else. Keel handles all of that for us, from a single schema.

## Next Steps

We've just scratched the surface on models, fields, actions, and permissions. There's a lot more to explore, including custom actions, jobs, and more. You can explore the rest of the docs to learn more about the Keel schema language and how to build powerful backends with it.
