## Advanced Tutorial

Keel enables you with an instant fullstack API that can use to power your applications with zero stress. It abstracts away a huge chunk of the difficulties that come with building fullstack applications with low code.

With Keel, you can define an API with models and define various operations that can be performed on the API.

In this tutorial, we will build the backend of a [SaaS app](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/software-as-a-service-saas.asp) with Keel.
