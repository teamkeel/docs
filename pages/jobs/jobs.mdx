# What are Jobs?

Jobs are the Keel way to deal with tasks that either:

- You want to "fire" automatically, on a scheduled basis (like every Friday)
- Take hours to run (like a batch data import)

You specify them just like everything else - in your Schema

```keel filename="schema.keel"
job EmailNewCustomerReport {
    @schedule("* * * * 5")
}
```

That schedule says "every Friday" - using the widely-used [cron](https://devhints.io/cron) format.

Friday being the fifth day of the week.

## So What Happens?

It simply runs your function called `EmailNewCustomerReport` which it expects to find in your
project's `./jobs directory`.

Once you've specified your Job in the Schema, you can run `keel generate` in the CLI - and it will auto-generate the "skeleton" for your function in 
your `jobs` directory, ready to put some logic code into.

It looks like this:

```tsx filename="jobs/emailNewCustomerReport.ts"
export default EmailNewCustomerReport(async (ctx) => {
  // your logic code here
});
```

# What Can Job Functions Do?
Pretty much anything you like.

So for example:
- They have read and write access to your database - via the `Model API`
- They can make requests to external services using `fetch`
- They can import and use any third party npm packages of your choice

One thing they **cannot** do though is receive an input. Note how the generated function signature does not specify
an input argument.

By the way, we have **manual** jobs coming soon that you'll be able to fire whenever you want, manually,
from the Keel console. **For these** you will be able to
specify inputs in your Schema. (Because now there'll be a human firing the job who can provide the input data).

# How to Develop, Test And Debug Your Job

The CLI includes support for running jobs - to help you develop and debug your Function.

But you do it with the CLI's Test command - but don't forget `keel test` does not touch your real database. Instead it uses a special dedicated temporary database for each test run. That means you can experiment with creating Models in your database over and over without messing up your real database.

### Here's how you use `keel test` for Jobs

# todo

- work out how to tell the console story properly
- switch in better screenshots 
- permissions
- code examples
- the `ctx` argument
- a job can have more than one schedule
- provide more cross references to say functions, the CLI, the model API etc
- split the content across a few (shorter) pages
- replace the "cron" external link to a better one
