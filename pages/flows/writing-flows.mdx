# Writing flows

The [introduction page](/flows) demonstrated how to write a simple flow with a function step, a UI step, and some logic in between. This page covers the important mechanics of how flows execute.

## Flow architecture

A flow is made up of the following discernable parts:

 - **Inputs:** Values passed into the body of the flow implementation
 - **Body:** The implementation of the flow in TypeScript, containing code and any number of steps
 - **Steps:** Durable units of work defined in TypeScript

A step can either be a:

 - **Function step:** Executes background logic in a durable way
 - **UI step:** Presents interfaces to a user and waits on them for input

A flow's body can be made up of code and any number of steps. If no durable execution or user input is needed, steps aren't necessary and the flow body can contain all the code logic needed.

## Flow lifecycle

A flow instance can execute multiple times, but each step executes successfully only once. When a step completes, its data persists and returns to the flow body. On subsequent executions, previously returned data substitutes for re-execution.

The flow body executes from the start each time a new step is encountered, continuing until the step completes. This ensures fresh data handling.

Example flow for order delivery:

```ts
export default DispatchOrder({}, async (ctx, inputs) => {
    // This will execute with every pass of the flow because we always want to get the latest data.
    const order = await models.order.findOne({ id: inputs.orderId });
    if (order.status == OrderStatus.Shipped) {
        throw new Error("order has already been shipped");
    }

    // Present the order address to the user for correcting. This must only ever happen once.
    const { address } = await ctx.ui.page("confirm address", {
        title: "Address confirmation",
        stage: "selectOrder",
        description: "Please update the delivery address where necessary",
        content: [
            ctx.ui.input.text("address", {
                label: "Select order",
                optional: false,
                placeholder: order.deliveryAddress,
            }),
        ],
    });

    // Submit this order to the courier company and retrieve the tracking number. This must only ever happen once.
    const trackingNumber = await ctx.step("submit to courier", async () => {
        return submitToCourier(order);
    });

    // Now update the order accordingly.
    await models.order.update(
        { id: inputs.orderId },
        { 
            trackingNumber: trackingNumber,
            deliveryAddress: address,
            status: DeliveryStatus.Shipped
        }
    );
});
```

## Inputs

A flow can be defined to accept inputs. Flows support all of the standard Keel types and the inputs can be defined as optional or required. These inputs are captured once, right when a new instance of a flow is started, and are then passed to your flow implementation as arguments.

For example, a flow that processes an order might be defined in the schema as follows.

```keel
flow ProcessOrder {
  inputs {
    orderId ID
    priority Boolean
  }
  @permission(roles: [Manager])
}
```

These values are captured when starting and flow, and are passed to the body of the flow in `inputs`.

```ts
export default ProcessOrder({}, async (ctx, inputs) => {
    // The inputs are available throughout the flow
    const order = await models.order.findOne({ id: inputs.orderId });
    
    if (inputs.priority) {
        // Handle priority orders differently
    }
    
    // Continue with normal processing...
});
```

  After defining your flow in the schema, running `keel generate` at the root of your project will scaffold out your new flow in the `/flows` directory.

## Flow context

As already demonstrated, the `ctx` argument passed into the flow body is used to define function and UI steps, but it also passes in other useful information to the flow, as highlighted in the table below.

| Property | Description | Example |
|:---------|:------------|:--------|
| `step` | Defines a function step | `await ctx.step("my step", async () => { ... });` |
| `page` | Defines a UI step | `await ctx.page({ ... });` |
| `identity` | The identity executing the flow | `ctx.identity.email` |
| `env` | Your [environment variables](/envvars) | `ctx.env.STRIPE_CUSTOMER_ID` |
| `secrets` | Your [environment secrets](/secrets) | `ctx.secrets.STRIPE_API_KEY` |

## Failures

If an exception is thrown in the body of a flow, then the entire flow will stop and its status will be set to `FAILED`. This is different from function step failures, which will trigger retry attempts as described in the [function steps documentation](/flows/functions#retry-logic).

## Duration of execution

Flow execution has a 15-minute threshold per step. Since steps execute independently, total flow runtime is unlimited. Flows can run for days or weeks if individual steps stay within timeout limits.

## Concurrency

Steps must execute sequentially. Use `async` when calling steps (`async ctx.step` or `async ctx.page`) to ensure proper execution order and result handling. We do not support concurrent execution yet.
