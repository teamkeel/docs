# Permissions

Flows must have a role to be accessible by users. You can define a role in the Keel schema using the `@permission` directive.
Only Flows that match the user's role will be visible in the console.

```keel
role Staff {
	domains {
		"myco.com"
	}
}

flow RefundOrder {
	inputs {
		orderId Text?
	}
	@permission(roles: [Staff])
}
```

### Permission expressions

Support for permission expressions for Flows is coming soon.
