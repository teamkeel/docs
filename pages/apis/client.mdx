# Generated API client

With Keel, you get a generated TypeScript client for your frontend projects to easily work with your APIs with full end to end type safety using the Keel [CLI](/cli).


import { Callout } from "nextra/components";

<Callout>
Requires version **0.351.0** or higher of the CLI
</Callout>

## Generating the client

To generate the client, use the `client` command in the CLI from within a Keel project

```bash
 keel client
```

This will generate a single file with zero dependancies in your current directory.

To output the client directly into your frontend project you can either pass an output path

```bash
keel client --output ../myFrontend/src
```

or by running the CLI from your frontend project and referencing the Keel directory

```bash
keel client -d ../myKeelApp
```

This will generate a client for the first API in your project. If you have multiple APIs you can specify which API to generate for with the `-a apiName` flag

<Callout type="info">
This client uses fetch so will only work in environments where fetch is available
</Callout>

## Using the client

First, import `APIClient` from the generated file and create a new instance with the deployed url of your project (or the [localhost](http://localhost) address if running locally)

<Callout emoji="ℹ️" type="info">
This `baseUrl` url should include the API name path but not the protocol (e.g. json/rpc/gql). For a local environment with `keel run`, this will be `http://localhost:8000/api`.
</Callout>

```ts
import { APIClient } from "../keelClient";

const client = new APIClient({
  baseUrl: process.env.API_BASE_URL, // http://localhost:8000/api
});
```

### Navigating the Generated client

The generated client is segmented into three parts, api, client, and ctx.

#### api

This includes all the actions that you have specified in your Keel schema. For example, if you have an action that lists all users, here is how you can use the generated client to execute this action on the client-side:

```ts
const client = new APIClient({
  baseUrl: process.env.API_BASE_URL, // http://localhost:8000/api
});

// use generated client to execute the action on the client-side
const allUsers = await client.api.queries.listUsers()

// log response from API to console
console.log(response.data?.results)
```

You can also use `.api.mutations` if you have actions that mutate data. For example, if you have an action that deletes a user, you can use it like so:

```ts
const client = new APIClient({
  baseUrl: process.env.API_BASE_URL, // http://localhost:8000/api
});

// use generated client to execute the action on the client-side
const response = await keel.api.mutations.createUser({ name: name, email: email});

// log response from API to console
console.log(response.data)
```

#### client

These are the core client actions that serve as configuration options for the client. They remain consistent across every Keel schema. They include:

- `setHeaders()`
- `setHeader()`
- `setBaseUrl()`
- `setToken()`
- `clearToken()`

#### ctx

This provides access to user authentication state. It includes the following options:

- `isAuthenticated: boolean`
- `token: string`

**Usage:**
```ts
const client = new APIClient({
  baseUrl: process.env.API_BASE_URL, // http://localhost:8000/api
});

// returns a boolean that represents if a user is authenticated or not
client.ctx.isAuthenticated

// returns the bearer token if available
client.ctx.token
```


### Authenticating 
{/* @todo in a separate PR redo this with the new auth*/}
If your API requires authentication, use the `authenticate` action as normal and then store the returned token to be used for subsequent requests

```tsx
const auth = await client.api.mutations.authenticate({
  emailPassword: {
    email: "me@keel.so",
    password: "topsecret",
  },
  createIfNotExists: true,
});

if (auth.error) {
  console.log("Auth failed", auth.error.type);
  return;
}

console.log("Authenticated");
```

On logout remember to clear the token

```tsx
client.client.clearToken();
```

### Error handling

The response of an action is a promise that resolves to an object that either contains the data or an error object

```tsx
type Data<T> = {
  data: T;
  error?: never;
};

type Error = {
  data?: never;
  error: ErrorObj ;
};

type ErrorObj = {
  type: "forbidden" | "not_found" | "internal_server_error" | "unknown" | "unauthorized" | "bad_request";
  message: string;
  requestId?: string; // can be used to access traces in the console
};
```

You can then check the presence of the error object to handle any errors

```tsx
const myAction = await client.myAction({
  input: "foo"
});

if (myAction.error) {
  console.log("Failed", myAction.error.type);
  return;
}

const { data } = myAction

// Do things with the data
```
