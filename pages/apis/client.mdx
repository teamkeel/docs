# Generated TypeScript client

The generated TypeScript client provides you with an end-to-end, type-safe client library which you can use to easily authenticate and query your Keel APIs for frontend projects.  It has the following primary features:

 - A type-safe SDK of your Keel API
 - Support for Password, ID Token and Single Sign-On authentication
 - Automatic refreshing of expiring access token

import { Callout } from "@core/callout";

<Callout>
Requires version **0.380.0** or higher of the Keel [CLI](/cli).
</Callout>

## Generating the client

To generate the client, use the `client` command in the [CLI](/cli) from within a Keel project

```bash
 keel client
```

This will generate a single file with zero dependancies in your current directory.

To output the client directly into your frontend project you can either pass an output path.

```bash
keel client --output ../myFrontend/src
```

Or by running the CLI from your frontend project and referencing the Keel directory

```bash
keel client -d ../myKeelApp
```

This will generate a client for the first API in your project. If you have multiple APIs you can specify which API to generate for with the `-a apiName` flag

<Callout type="info">
This client uses fetch so will only work in environments where fetch is available
</Callout>

## Using the client

First, import `APIClient` from the generated file and create a new instance with the deployed url of your project (or the [localhost](http://localhost) address if running locally)

<Callout   type="info">
This `baseUrl` url should include the API name path but not the protocol (e.g. json/rpc/gql). For a local environment with `keel run`, this will be `http://localhost:8000/api`.
</Callout>

```ts
import { APIClient } from "../keelClient";

const keel = new APIClient({
  baseUrl: process.env.API_BASE_URL, // http://localhost:8000/api
});
```

### Navigating the Generated client

The generated client is segmented into three parts; `api`, `auth`, and `client`.

#### api

This includes all the actions that you have specified in your Keel schema. For example, if you have an action that lists all users, here is how you can use the generated client to execute this action on the client-side:

```ts
const keel = new APIClient({
  baseUrl: process.env.API_BASE_URL, // http://localhost:8000/api
});

// use generated client to execute the action on the client-side
const allUsers = await keel.api.queries.listUsers()

// log response from API to console
console.log(response.data?.results)
```

You can also use `.api.mutations` if you have actions that mutate data. For example, if you have an action that deletes a user, you can use it like so:

```ts
const keel = new APIClient({
  baseUrl: process.env.API_BASE_URL, // http://localhost:8000/api
});

// use generated client to execute the action on the client-side
const response = await keel.api.mutations.createUser({ name: name, email: email});

// log response from API to console
console.log(response.data)
```

#### auth

Here you are able to authenticate identities with any of our supported authentication flows.

- `providers()`: Returns the currently configured 3rd party authentication providers and their [Single Sign-On](/authentication/flows/sso) login URLs.
- `authenticateWithPassword()`: Authenticate with the [password flow](/authentication/flows/password).
- `authenticateWithIdToken()`: Authenticate with an [ID Token](/authentication/flows/id-token).
- `authenticateWithSingleSignOn()`: Authenticate with an authorization code acquired from [Single Sign-On authentication](/authentication/flows/sso).
- `isAuthenticated()`: Returns true if the session has not expired. If expired, it will attempt to refresh the session from the authentication server.
- `refresh()`: Forcefully refreshes the session with the authentication server.
- `logout()`: Logs out the session on the client and revokes the refresh token with the authentication server.

#### client

These are the core client actions that serve as configuration options for the client. They remain consistent across every Keel schema. They include:

- `setHeaders()`
- `setHeader()`
- `setBaseUrl()`

### Authenticating 

Authentication is simple with the generated client because access tokens and refresh tokens are handled implicitly.  Making authorized calls to your API happens under the hood.  The client will also automatically refresh expiring access tokens.

Once authenticated, the client stores the active session in memory. This means that when a new instance of the client is created the session will be lost and authentication will need to take place again.  However, you can [implement your own token persistence](#session-persistence) in order to retain authentication over a longer period and between browser sessions.

#### Password authentication

First, let's demonstrate how to authenticate the client with an [email and password](/authentication/flows/id-token).

```ts
const keel = new APIClient({
  baseUrl: process.env.API_BASE_URL,
});

// authenticate the client with email and password
const response = await keel.auth.authenticateWithPassword({ email: email, password: pass });
if (response.error) {
  // an error occurred
}

// check that the client is still authenticated
const isAuthenticatedResponse = await keel.auth.isAuthenticated();
if (response.data) {
  // the client is still authenticated
}

// perform an authenticated request to your Keel API
const createPost = await keel.api.mutations.createBlogPost({ title: title });
```

#### ID Token authentication

With [ID Token authentication](/authentication/flows/id-token), you would have already configured the 3rd-party authentication provider correctly in your `keelconfig.yaml` and you would have performed the necessary authentication flow with that provider in order to acquire an ID Token.  Once you have this ID Token, you can authenticate as shown below.

```ts
// authenticate the client using an ID token from a 3rd-party provider
const response = await keel.auth.authenticateWithIdToken({ idToken: idToken });
```

#### Single Sign-On authentication

With [Single Sign-On authentication](/authentication/flows/sso), you would have started the authentication flow by redirecting the user's browser to the `authorizeUrl` URL found when calling `await keel.auth.providers()`.  When handling the callback (the `redirectUrl` as configured in your `keelconfig.yaml`), you can then use the authorization code received to authenticate the client.

```ts
// authenticate the client using an authorization code from Single Sign-On
const response = await keel.auth.authenticateWithSingleSignOn({ code: authCode });
```

#### Sign in and sign up

Both the `authenticateWithPassword()` and `authenticateWithIdToken()` functions also accept the optional argument 'createIfNotExists'.  Setting this to `false` will not create a new identity if it doesn't exist - i.e. a sign in flow. 

The response from a successful `authenticateWithPassword()`, `authenticateWithIdToken()`, or `authenticateWithSingleSignOn()` includes the field  `identityCreated`.  This will be `true` when the identity was created as a result of authentication - i.e. the identity has signed up. See example below.

```ts
const response = await keel.auth.authenticateWithSingleSignOn({ code: authCode });

if (response.error) { 
  // an error occurred
}

if (response.data.identityCreated) {
  // a new identity was created
}
```

#### Token refresh and expiry

The client will automatically refresh your access token until such a point that the refresh token has expired.  This means that you do not need to concern yourself with refreshing at all.  It also supports **Refresh Token Rotation**, if enabled, which we highly recommend.

However, if the session has expired (i.e. the refresh token has expired), you will be required to reauthenticate the identity to start a new session.  

```ts
const response = await keel.api.mutations.createBlogPost({ title: title });

if (response.error && response.error.type == "forbidden") {
  request.redirect(302, "/login");
  return;
} 
```

#### Session persistence

Because the client only stores the session state in memory, you will need to reauthenticate each time the client is reinstantiated.  However, you can implement a custom token store to persist sessions.  This is done by implementing a very simple interface, as shown below.

```ts
interface TokenStore {
  // Set a token in the store
  set(token: string | null): void;

  // Retrieve a token from the store
  get(): string | null;
}
```

For example, shown below is an example of implementing browser localStorage token store.

```ts
class LocalStorageStore {
  #key = "keel-refresh-token";

  get = () => {
    return localStorage.get(#key);
  };

  set = (token: string | null): void => {
    if (token) {
      localStorage.set(#key, token);
    } else {
      localStorage.removeItem(#key);
    }
  };
}
```

The client can then be configured to use this store:

```ts
const keel = new APIClient({
  baseUrl: process.env.API_BASE_URL,
  refreshTokenStore: new LocalStorageStore()
});
```

Note that you can also provide a custom store implementation for access tokens, however it's important to remember that access tokens are typically short-lived and only need to be persisted if you're unable to reuse them between requests.

```ts
const keel = new APIClient({
  baseUrl: process.env.API_BASE_URL,
  accessTokenStore: new LocalStorageStore(),
  refreshTokenStore: new HttpOnlyCookieStore()
});
```

#### Server-side usage

By default, the generated client persists sessions in memory. This is **not suitable** for server-side applications and framework with SSR such as Next.js or Remix.

For these applications, it's critical that the client is created per request and cookie storage is used to persist the tokens.

For example, with Next.js, you can create a client with cookie storage as shown below.

```ts
import { deleteCookie, getCookie, setCookie } from 'cookies-next';

export const keelClient = async (context?: OptionsType) => {
  return new APIClient({
    baseUrl: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_KEEL_BASE_URL,
    accessTokenStore: {
      get: () => {
        return getCookie(ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY, context) || null;
      },
      set: async (token) => {
        token
          ? setCookie(ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY, token, context)
          : deleteCookie(ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY, context);
      },
    },
    refreshTokenStore: {
      get: () => {
        return getCookie(REFRESH_TOKEN_KEY, context) || null;
      },
      set: async (token) => {
        token
          ? setCookie(REFRESH_TOKEN_KEY, token, context)
          : deleteCookie(REFRESH_TOKEN_KEY, context);
      },
    },
  });
};
```

And then use this client in your `getServerSideProps` function, passing the request context.

```ts
export const getServerSideProps = (async (context) => {
  const keel = await keelClient(context);
  // Use the client...
});
```

### Error handling

The response of an action is a `Promise` that resolves to an object that either contains the `data` or an `error` object.

```tsx
type Data<T> = {
  data: T;
  error?: never;
};

type Error = {
  data?: never;
  error: ErrorObj ;
};

type ErrorObj = {
  type: "forbidden" | "not_found" | "internal_server_error" | "unknown" | "unauthorized" | "bad_request";
  message: string;
  requestId?: string; // can be used to access traces in the console
};
```

You can then check the presence of the `error` object to handle any errors

```tsx
const myAction = await keel.myAction({
  input: "foo"
});

if (myAction.error) {
  console.log("Failed", myAction.error.type);
  return;
}

const { data } = myAction

// Do things with the data
```
