# GraphQL API

[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) is an open-source data query language that allows clients to specify the data they need from the API. It also allows querying data across relational data models, meaning that you can do in one API call what might otherwise require several.

The GraphQL endpoint for your Keel app is `/api/graphql`. When running locally with `keel run` you can also access a [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) playground at `/api/graphiql`.

## Queries & Mutations

GraphQL has the concept of **queries** which are for reading data and **mutations** which are for writing data. Any **get**, **list**, and **read** actions in your Keel schema become queries in your GraphQL API whilst **create**, **update**, **delete**, and **write** actions become mutations.

All queries or mutations in your GraphQL API accept a single input value called `input`.

## Types

The built-in Keel types are mapped to GraphQL types in the following way:

| Keel type | GraphQL type |
| --- | --- |
| `Text` | `String` |
| `Number` | `Int` |
| `Boolean` | `Boolean` |
| `Timestamp` | `Timestamp` (custom type) |
| `Date` | `Date` (custom type) |

### Optional / Required

In a Keel schema fields are required by default, but can be marked optional by adding `?` after the type. In a GraphQL schema it's the *other way around*, with fields being optional by default and `!` after the type indicating the field is required.

This means that if a field in your Keel is schema does not have a `?` after it's type, then it will have a `!` after it in GraphQL.

```keel filename="schema.keel"
model Profile {
  fields {
    username Text
    realname Text?
  }
}
```

```graphql filename="Generated GraphQL type"
type Profile {
  username: String!
  realname: String
}
```

This applies to model fields, action inputs, and message fields.

### Timestamp & Date

The `Timestamp` and `Date` types in a Keel schema correspond to the following GraphQL types.

```graphql filename="Built-in Timestamp and Date GraphQL types"
type Timestamp {
  # a value based on the provided format
  formatted(format: String!): String!
  
  # a value like "in 2 days" or "5 months ago"
  fromNow: String!

  # ISO-8601 format string e.g. "2023-05-27T15:02:14.185Z"
  iso8601: String!

  # Unix time
  seconds: Int!
}

type Date {
  # a value based on the provided format
  formatted(format: String!): String!

  # ISO-8601 format string e.g. "2023-05-27"
  iso8601: String!
}
```

The `formatted` field of these types accept a format string that contain the following placeholders.

| Placeholder | Description | Example (for 2023-01-02 14:09:05) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| YYYY | full year | "2023" |
| YY | short year | "23" |
| MMMM | full month | "January" |
| MMM | abbreviated month | "Jan" |
| MM | zero-padded month number | "01" |
| M | month number | "1" |
| DDDD | zero-padded day of year | "002" |
| DD | zero-padded day of month | "02" |
| D | day of month | "2" |
| dddd | full day of week | "Thursday" |
| ddd | abbreviated day of week | "Thu" |
| HH | zero-padded hour (24-hour) | "14" |
| hh | zero-padded hour (12-hour) | "02" |
| h | hour (12-hour) | "2" |
| A | upper-case AM/PM | "PM" |
| a | lower-case am/pm | "pm" |
| mm | zero-padded minute | "09" |
| m | minute | "9" |
| ss | zero-padded seconds | "05" |
| s | seconds | "5" |
| ZZZ | time-zone with name | "UTC" |

### Models

Models defined in your Keel schema become types in your GraphQL API.

```keel filename="schema.keel"
model Profile {
  fields {
    username Text
  }
}
```

```graphql filename="Generated GraphQL schema"
type Profile {
  id: ID!
  createdAt: Timestamp!
  updatedAt: Timestamp!
  username: String!
}
```

You'll see that the GraphQL Person type contains all the built-in model fields as well as the ones you defined in your schema.

### Enums

Enums defined in your Keel schema become enums in your GraphQL API. GraphQL represents enums in exactly the same say as Keel.

```graphql
enum Category {
  Sports
  Finance
  Politics
}
```

## Creating a new record

You can define an action for creating a new record in your Keel schema using the **create** action type. These actions will become mutations in your GraphQL schema.

import { Tab, Tabs } from 'nextra-theme-docs'
 
<Tabs items={['Keel schema', 'GraphQL schema', 'GraphQL query']}>
  <Tab>
```keel {7} filename="schema.keel"
model Profile {
  fields {
    username Text @unique
    bio Text
  }
  actions {
    create createProfile() with (username, bio)
  }
}
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
```graphql {2} filename="Generated GraphQL schema"
type Mutation {
  createProfile(input: CreateProfileInput!): Profile!
}

input CreateProfileInput {
  username: String!
  bio: String!
}

type Profile {
  id: ID!
  username: String!
  bio: String!
  createdAt: Timestamp!
  updatedAt: Timestamp!
}
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
```graphql {2} filename="Example of using the createProfile mutation"
mutation {
  createProfile(input: { username: "mickeymouse", bio: "I am a cartoon mouse" }) {
    id
    username
    bio
  }
}
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Reading a single record

You can define an action for reading a single record in your Keel schema using the **get** action type. These actions will become queries in your GraphQL schema.

<Tabs items={['Keel schema', 'GraphQL schema', 'GraphQL query']}>
  <Tab>
```keel {6} filename="schema.keel"
model Profile {
  fields {
    username Text
  }
  actions {
    get getProfile(id)
  }
}
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
```graphql {2} filename="Generated GraphQL schema"
type Query {
  getProfile(input: GetProfileInput!): Profile
}

input GetProfileInput {
  id: ID!
}

type Profile {
  id: ID!
  username: String!
  createdAt: Timestamp!
  updatedAt: Timestamp!
}
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
```graphql {2}
query {
  getPerson(input: { id: "1234" }) {
    id
    username
  }
}
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Updating a record

You can define an action for updating a single record in your Keel schema using the **update** action type. These actions will become mutations in your GraphQL schema.

<Tabs items={['Keel schema', 'GraphQL schema', 'GraphQL query']}>
  <Tab>
```keel {7} filename="schema.keel"
model Profile {
  fields {
    username Text @unique
    bio Text
  }
  actions {
    update updateBio(id) with (bio)
  }
}
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
```graphql {2} filename="Generated GraphQL schema"
type Mutations {
  updateBio(input: UpdateBioInput!): Profile!
}

input UpdateBioInput {
  where: UpdateBioWhere!
  values: UpdateBioValues!
}

input UpdateBioWhere {
  id: ID!
}

input UpdateBioValues {
  bio: String!
}

type Profile {
  id: ID!
  username: String!
  createdAt: Timestamp!
  updatedAt: Timestamp!
}
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
```graphql {2-7}
mutation {
  updateBio(
    input: {
      where: { id: "1234" }
      values: { bio: "I'm a cartoon mouse who's always up for an adventure" }
    }
  ) {
    id
    username
    bio
  }
}
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Listing records

You can define an action for listing many records in your Keel schema using the **list** action type. These actions will become queries in your GraphQL schema. You'll see in the example below that the input types for **list** actions are a little more complex than the other action types, and this is because they allow for filtering records in a number of different ways. See the **Query Inputs** section below for more info on this.

<Tabs items={['Keel schema', 'GraphQL schema', 'GraphQL query']}>
  <Tab>
```keel {8} filename="schema.keel"
model Book {
  fields {
    title Text
    genre Text
    releaseDate Date
  }
  actions {
    list listBooks(title?, genre?, releaseDate?)
  }
}
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
```graphql filename="Generated GraphQL schema"
type Query {
  listBooks(input: ListBooksInput!): BookConnection!
}

type Book {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  genre: String!
  releaseDate: Date!
  createdAt: Timestamp!
  updatedAt: Timestamp!
}

input ListBooksInput {
  after: String
  before: String
  first: Int
  last: Int
  where: ListBooksWhere!
}

input ListPeopleWhere {
  title: StringQueryInput
  genre: StringQueryInput
  releaseDate: DateQueryInput
}

type BookConnection {
  edges: [BookEdge!]!
  pageInfo: PageInfo!
}

type BookEdge {
  node: Book!
}

type PageInfo {
  count: Int!
  endCursor: String!
  hasNextPage: Boolean!
  startCursor: String!
  totalCount: Int!
}

```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
```graphql
query {
  listBooks(
    input: {
      first: 10
      where: {
        title: { contains: "Love" }
        releaseDate: { after: "2022-01-01" }
      }
    }
  ) {
    edges {
      node {
        title
        releaseDate {
          formatted(format: "YYYY-MM-DD")
        }
      }
    }
    pageInfo {
      endCursor
    }
  }
}
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Query Inputs

We can use a **list** action to perform queries like:

* Find all books whose title contains the word "Love"
* Find all books whose genre is "Sci-Fi" or "Crime" and were released in the last year

This is possible because in a **list** action each input gets wrapped in a query type. For example an input that points to a `Text` field in a Keel schema will become a `StringQueryInput` in the GraphQL schema. The `StringQueryInput` looks like this:

```graphql
input StringQueryInput {
  contains: String
  endsWith: String
  equals: String
  notEquals: String
  oneOf: [String]
  startsWith: String
}
```

All Keel types have a corresponding GraphQL query type that allow filtering in ways that make sense for that type, for example the `StringQueryInput` type has a `contains` field whereas the `IntQueryInput` has a `greaterThan` field.

### Connection pattern

The response type of a **list** action in GraphQL follows the [Relay Connection Spec](https://relay.dev/graphql/connections.htm) which means that for a model called `Book` the response type of a **list** action in GraphQL will be a `BookConnection`.

```graphql
type BookConnection {
  edges: [BookEdge!]!
  pageInfo: PageInfo!
}

type BookEdge {
  node: Book!
}

type PageInfo {
  count: Int!
  endCursor: String!
  hasNextPage: Boolean!
  startCursor: String!
  totalCount: Int!
}
```

### Pagination

The input type for a **list** action has four fields that relate to pagination.

* `first` - Only return the first _N_ records. Can be used with `after`.
* `last` - Only return the last _N_ records. Can be used with `before`.
* `after` - Return records after this cursor.
* `before` - Return records before this cursor.

The `startCursor` and `endCursor` fields of a `PageType` can be passed to `after` or `before` in subsequent queries. For example if you fetched the first 10 book records and in the response the `endCursor` value was "1234" then to get the next 10 records you would pass "1234" to the `after` input.

## Functions

These docs talk about **actions**, which is the general term for both built-in actions (implemented by the Keel runtime) and functions (implemented by you using code). There is no difference between how built-in actions and functions are surfaced in GraphQL.

## Authentication

Authentication works in your GraphQL API by passing a bearer token as an `Authorization` header when making requests. You obtain a token by using the built-in `authenticate` mutation.

<Tabs items={['Authenticate GraphQL schema', 'Example']}>
  <Tab>
```graphql
type Mutation {
  authenticate(input: AuthenticateInput!): AuthenticateResponse
}

input AuthenticateInput {
  createIfNotExists: Boolean
  emailPassword: EmailPasswordInput!
}

input EmailPasswordInput {
  email: String!
  password: String!
}

type AuthenticateResponse {
  identityCreated: Boolean!
  token: String!
}
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
```graphql
mutation {
  authenticate(input: {
      emailPassword: { 
        email: "bob@disney.com", 
        password: "m1ck3ym0us3",
      }
  }) {
    token
  }
}
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Request Password Reset

You can use the built-in `requestPasswordReset` mutation to request that a password reset token is sent to the user.

```graphql
mutation {
  requestPasswordReset(input: {email: "bob@disney.com", redirectUrl: "https://www.disney.com/resetPassword"}) {
    success
  }
}
```

If a user (Identity) exists with the given email address they will receive an email containing the link to the URL provided as `redirectUrl` with a `token` parameter appended to it. That token can be used with the `resetPassword` mutation to actually reset a users password.

### Reset a password

Once you have obtained a password reset token you can sent it, along with the users new password, to the `resetPassword` mutation.

```graphql
mutation {
  resetPassword(input: {password: "iwontforgetthisone", token: "abc123"}) {
    success
  }
}
```
