# Functions

Functions allow you to implement actions using code, but they are so much more than just "serverless functions". Your functions are deeply integrated into your app, meaning that inputs are validated, authentication and permissions are handled for you, and you have full access to your database.

We currently support TypeScript for writing functions and your function code should be located in the `functions` directory of your project, with each function in its own file named the same as the function in the schema. So if you have a function called `doTheThing` in your schema, the code for this function would be located at `functions/doTheThing.ts`. 

## A simple function

Functions can use the same action types as operations, for example `get`, `list` and so on. To illustrate how functions work lets implement a simple `get` function.

```keel filename="schema.keel"
model Product {
  functions {
    get getProduct(id)
  }
}
```

If we then run `keel generate` a function file will be created for us which will look something like this.

```tsx filename="functions/getProduct.ts"
import { GetProduct } from "@teamkeel/sdk";

export default GetProduct(async (ctx, inputs) => {
  // your code here
});
```

The `@teamkeel/sdk` package is auto-generated based on your schema and contains wrapper functions for each of your schema-defined functions. These wrapper functions ensure that your code is correctly typed without having to explicitly declare types.

To implement this function we can use the generated model API's available from the `@teamkeel/sdk` package.

```tsx filename="functions/getProduct.ts"
import { GetProduct, models } from "@teamkeel/sdk";

export default GetProduct((ctx, inputs) => {
  return models.product.findOne({
    id: inputs.id,
  });
});
```

That's it, our function will now work as expected. Obviously this example is very simple, and in practice this kind of action would be defined as an operation in our schema, but it illustrates the basics of how to implement a function.

## Function arguments

Your functions receive two arguments.

- `ctx` - a context object which contains things like the authenticated Identity, environment variables and secrets, and request headers
- `inputs` - the inputs provided by the caller of your function

## Using the database

The `@teamkeel/sdk` package is generated based on your schema and contains type-safe API's for interacting with your models. These API's are all available on the exported `models` object.

See [Model API](/functions/sdk/modelApi) for full usage.

### Reading a single record

As shown in the simple example at the start of this page, we can read a single record by using the `findOne` model API.

```tsx filename="functions/getProduct.ts"
import { GetProduct, models } from "@teamkeel/sdk";

export default GetProduct(async (ctx, inputs) => {
  return models.product.findOne({
    id: inputs.id,
  });
});
```

The return type of a **get** function is `Promise<Model | null>`, which conveniently matches the model API method `findOne`. So for a simple function like this we can just return the result of `findOne`.

### Reading multiple records

To find and return many records you can use `findMany` model API method. The following schema defines a `list` function which takes no inputs.

```keel filename="schema.keel"
model Product {
  functions {
    list latestProducts()
  }
}
```

Below is an example implementation of `latestProducts`.

```tsx filename="functions/latestProducts.ts"
import { ListProducts, models } from "@teamkeel/sdk";
import sub from 'date-fns/sub';

export default LatestProducts((ctx, inputs) => {
  const oneWeekAgo = sub(ctx.now(), {
    days: 7,
  });

  return models.product.findMany({
    createdAt: {
      after: oneWeekAgo,
    },
  });
});
```

A few things to note in this example:

- The use of the `@date-fns` package - you can use any 3rd party packages you like in your functions. Just install them as you normally (currently only `npm` is supported).
- The use of `ctx.now()` to get the current date. The third argument to your functions is a `ctx` object which is very similar to the `ctx` available in schema expressions.
- Using the `after` filter on the `createdAt` field in the `findMany` call. There are many filtering fields available when using `findMany` which are explained in more detail later on in this page.

The `findMany` model API method returns `Promise<Model[]>`, which is also the expected return type of a **list** function, so we can return the result of that method directly.

### Creating a new record

To create a new record in the database you use the `create` model API method. The following schema defines a function for creating a new post.

```keel filename="schema.keel"
model Author {}

model Post {
  fields {
    title Text
    body Text
    author Author
  }

  functions {
    create createPost() with (title, body, author.id)
  }
}
```

A simple implementation of `createPost` might look something like this.

```tsx filename="functions/createPost.ts"
import { CreatePost, models } from "@teamkeel/sdk";

export default CreatePost(async (ctx, inputs) => {
  const { title, body, author } = inputs;

  return models.post.create({
    title,
    body,
    // we set authorId here, which is the auto-generated 
    // foreign key for the author field in the model
    authorId: author.id,
  });
});
```

The return type of `create` is `Promise<Model>`, which is also the expected return type of a **create** function.

### Updating a record

To update an existing record in the database you can use the `update` model API method. This accepts two arguments, an object containing filters that indicate which record should be updated, and an object containing the values to update.

To illustrate how an `update` function might work, the following schema defines a `publishPost` function with just accepts the `id` of the post to publish.

```keel filename="schema.keel"
model Account {
  fields {
    identity Identity @unique
  }
}

model Post {
  fields {
    published Boolean
    publishedAt Timestamp
    publishedBy Account
  }

  functions {
    update publishPost(id)
  }
}
```

In the implementation for this function we need to do a few things:

- Get the `Account` that is linked to the calling Identity
- Build the where conditions object for the update
- Build the values object for the update

```tsx filename="functions/publishPost.ts"
import { PublishPost, models } from "@teamkeel/sdk";

export default PublishPost(async (ctx, inputs) => {
  // first find the account of the authenticated user
  const account = await models.account.findOne({
    identityId: ctx.identity.id,
  });

  // the where conditions for the update is just the provided id
  const where = inputs.where;

  // the values we want to update
  const values = {
    published: true,
    publishedAt: ctx.now(),
    publishedById: account.id,
  };

  // update and return the record
  return models.post.update(where, values);
});
```

This example also shows how you can access the Identity of the person performing the action by using `ctx.identity`. 

### Custom database queries

If you need more complex database operations you can use the [Database API](/functions/sdk/databaseApi) to write custom queries.

## Using `fetch`

We deploy your functions into an environment running Node.js 18.x, which means the Fetch API is available.

One example of using `fetch` is to proxy API calls to a 3rd party service through your Keel API's. This is often useful if the API you want to use requires an API key and you don't want to expose that to your frontend. 

The following example uses the special `Any` message type to allow any input and any response from the `doSomething` function.

```keel filename="schema.keel"
model MyThing {
  functions {
    read doSomething(Any) returns (Any)
  }
}
```

The function implementation calls the 3rd party API, passing the API token, and return its response.

```tsx filename="functions/doSomething.ts"
import {DoSomething} from "@teamkeel/sdk";

export default DoSomething(async (ctx, inputs) => {
  // make an API call to 3rd party
  const res = await fetch("https://some-cool-api.com", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      // use a secret to store your API token
      "Api-Token": ctx.secrets.API_TOKEN,
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      some: "param",
    }),
  });

  // return the response as JSON
  return res.json();
});
```

## Using Headers

You can access request headers by using `ctx.headers`, which is a *read-only* version of the `[Headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Headers)` object, and you can set response headers by using `ctx.response.headers` which is a normal [`Headers`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Headers) object.

```tsx filename="functions/myFunction.ts"
export default MyFunction((inputs, api, ctx) => {
  // read a request header
  const reqHeader = ctx.headers.get("X-My-Custom-Header");
  
  // write a response header
  ctx.response.headers.set("X-My-Other-Header", "1234");
});
```

## Environment Variables and Secrets

Any environment variables you've defined in your `keelconfig.yaml` file will be available in your functions by using `ctx.env`, which is typed according to the environment variables you've defined in your config file. No more un-typed `process.env` ðŸŽ‰

In much the same way, any secrets you've defined in your `keelconfig.yaml` file will be available on `ctx.secrets`, which is also typed. As secrets are sensitive values they are not set as environment variables and are only accessible by using `ctx.secrets`.

As an example if we have the following `keelconfig.yaml` file.

```yaml filename="keelconfig.yaml"
environment:
  default:
    - name: MY_ENV_VAR
      value: "some-value"
secrets:
	- name: MY_SECRET
```

We could then access these in a function like so.

```tsx filename="functions/myFunction.ts"
export default MyFunction(async (ctx, inputs) => {
  ctx.env.MY_ENV_VAR // "some-value"
  ctx.secrets.MY_SECRET // will be decrypted secret value

  // TypeScript will catch this with the error:
  // ts(2339) Property 'FOO' does not exist on type 'Environment'.
  ctx.env.FOO

  // TypeScript will catch this with the error:
  // ts(2339) Property 'FOO' does not exist on type 'Secrets'.
  ctx.secrets.FOO
});
```

## Custom functions

There may be cases where you want to define a function that returns custom data or needs to receive unknown data as input. For these situations, you can use the `read` and `write` action types with **messages**.

### Custom inputs and responses

To illustrate how custom functions work we will create a batch create function. The built-in Keel action types do not support this, but it can be implemented using the `write` action type and messages.

```keel filename="schema.keel"
enum Genre {
  Horror
  Romance
}

model Book {
  fields {
    title Text
    genre Genre
  }
  functions {
    write createBooks(CreateBooksInput) returns (CreateBooksResponse)
  }
}
```

Actions that use the `read` or `write` type must take a message as input and use the `returns` keyword to define the response message. The following example demonstrates how to define the messages we used in the `createBooks` action.

```keel filename="schema.keel"
message CreateBooksInput {
  // messages can be nested
  books CreateBooksBookFields[]
}

message CreateBooksBookFields {
  title Text
  // messages can contain enums
  genre Genre
}

message CreateBooksResponse {
  // messages can contain models
  books Book[]
}
```

Messages are defined using the `message` keyword and have the same syntax as the `fields` block in a model definition. Message fields can be other messages, models, enums, or built-in Keel types. 

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

<Callout>
  Message names must be **UpperCamelCase** and must be distinct from any model or enum name.
</Callout>

There is nothing really different about the code for functions that use messages, and they will still be correctly typed. The implementation for `createBooks` might look like this.

```tsx filename="functions/createBooks.ts"
import { CreateBooks, models } from "@teamkeel/sdk";

export default CreateBooks(async (ctx, input) => {
  const books = await Promise.all(
    input.books.map((fields) => {
      return models.book.create({
        title: fields.title,
        genre: fields.genre,
      });
    })
  );

  return {
    books,
  };
});
```

### The `Any` message

The built-in message `Any` can be used as the input or response of a `read` or `write` function. When you use this message the inputs or return type of your function will be the TypeScript type `any`. The `Any` message is useful if you want to receive unknown or arbitrary data in your function or return dynamic data.


### Permissions

For custom `read` or `write` functions you must implement any permissions logic in your code. This can be done by importing the `permissions` from the `@teamkeel/sdk` package and using the `allow()` and `deny()` methods.

```tsx filename="functions/createBooks.ts"
import { permissions } from "@teamkeel/sdk";

export default CustomAction(async (ctx, input) => {
  
  if (ctx.headers.get("X-custom-auth-header") == ctx.secrets.AUTH_KEY) {
    permissions.allow()
  } else {
    return
  }

  // checking row level access
  if (item.owner != ctx.identity.id) {
    permissions.deny()
  }
  
});
```

By default, functions will return permission denied until `allow()` is called so `deny()` only needs to be called if you are explicitly denying access in your code after an `allow()` call.
