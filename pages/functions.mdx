# Functions

Functions allow you to implement actions using code, but they are so much more than just "serverless functions". Your functions are deeply integrated into your app, meaning that inputs are validated, authentication and permissions are handled for you, and you have full access to your database.

We currently support TypeScript for writing functions and your function code should be located in the `functions` directory of your project, with each function in its own file named the same as the function in the schema. So if you have a function called `doTheThing` in your schema, the code for this function would be located at `functions/doTheThing.ts`.

Once you have described your function in your schema, you can run `keel generate` via the [CLI](/cli) to scaffold the code for your functions and put files in the right place to get you started. Then, you'd just fill in your application-specific logic in the generated file and you're good to go. 

Keel supports two main types of functions:

1. [Action functions](#action-functions) that are defined on existing actions like `get`, `create`, `update`, and so on. These functions **modify the default behaviour of a built-in action** by *hooking* in to the lifecycle of the action. For example, you might want to add constraints to a query before it is run, or perform custom permission logic on the returned rows after the data returns from the database.

2. [Custom functions](#custom-functions) that are unrelated to any built-in action. These functions are defined using the `read` or `write` action types and allow you to define custom inputs and responses. These functions are the closest to what you might think of as an [API route in Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) as they are not tied to any built-in action. They are still deeply integrated into your app, however, and you can still use the built-in Keel types and APIs to interact with your database. You'd use this type of function to communicate with 3rd party APIs, do batch operations, or perform other custom logic.

## Context

All functions receive a context object as their first argument. This object is very similar to the `ctx` object that can be used in expressions in your Keel schema. It provides type-safe access to [secrets](/secrets) and [environment variables](/envvars), as well as the [identity](/identity) of the caller.

```ts
type Secrets = {
  // populated from the secrets defined in your keelconfig.yaml
};

type Environment = {
  // populated from the environment variables defined in your keelconfig.yaml
};

type Context = {
  secrets: Secrets;
  env: Environment;
  identity?: Identity;
  now(): Date;
};
```

## Action functions

Functions can use the same action types as actions, for example `get`, `list` and so on. To make a built-in action a function, we apply the `@function` attribute. To illustrate how functions work lets implement a simple `get` function.

```keel filename="schema.keel"
model Product {
  actions {
    get getProduct(id) @function
  }
}
```

If we then run `keel generate` a function file will be created for us which will look something like this.

```tsx filename="functions/getProduct.ts"
import { GetProduct } from "@teamkeel/sdk";

// To learn more about what you can do with hooks,
// visit https://docs.keel.so/functions
const hooks: GetProductHooks = {};

export default GetProduct(hooks);
```

The `@teamkeel/sdk` package is auto-generated based on your schema and contains wrapper functions for each of your schema-defined functions. These wrapper functions ensure that your code is correctly typed without having to explicitly declare types.

As you can see from this example all function hooks are optional, so even if no hooks are defined a function will still work correctly. We'll talk more about hooks in a bit, but for now they're fundamentally ways to do things around the lifecycle of the main `get` function which Keel still fully manages for you. For example, if we pass `id` in the inputs to the action, the function will query the database to find a product matching that `id` and return it.

### Hooks

Action function hooks allow you to **modify the default behaviour of a function**, for example you might want to add constraints to a query, run custom permission logic on the returned rows, create related data, or perform other side effects.

Each hook is described in detail below but this table shows which hooks are called for which action types.

| Hook          | **get** | **list** | **create** | **update** | **delete** |
| ------------- | ------- | -------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| `beforeQuery` | ✅      | ✅       | ❌         | ✅         | ✅         |
| `afterQuery`  | ✅      | ✅       | ❌         | ❌         | ❌         |
| `beforeWrite` | ❌      | ❌       | ✅         | ✅         | ✅         |
| `afterWrite`  | ❌      | ❌       | ✅         | ✅         | ✅         |

#### `beforeQuery`

The `beforeQuery` hook allows you to affect which records are being acted on. If this hook is not defined then a default query is executed based on the inputs your action accepts. This hook is passed the default query and may return a modified version of it, a new query, or database record(s).

##### Arguments

- `ctx` - a context object which contains things like the authenticated Identity, environment variables and secrets, and request headers
- `inputs` - the inputs provided by the caller of your function
- `query` - the default query that will be run

##### Example: extending the default query

By default, a query is generated based on the inputs your action accepts. For example, given the following schema:

```keel
model Film {
  fields {
    title Text
  }
  actions {
    listFilms(title) @function
  }
}
```

And an implementation of `listFilms` that looks like this:

```typescript filename="functions/listFilms.ts"
import { ListFilms } from "@teamkeel/sdk";

export default ListFilms({
  beforeQuery(ctx, inputs, query) {
    return query.where({
      title: {
        endsWith: "phantom menace",
      },
    });
  },
});
```

The `listFilms` action will now always filter for records whose title ends with "phantom menace". If you then called the `listFilms` action with the following request:

```json
{
  "where": {
    "title": {
      "startsWith": "star wars"
    }
  }
}
```

You would now get back films whose title starts with "star wars" **and** ends with "phantom menace". This example shows how you can _extend_ the default query for all actions that this hook is valid for.

##### Example: custom query

If you don't want the default query behaviour at all then you can return a new query object. To illustrate this the following schema defines a `get` function called `latestRelease`:

```keel
model Film {
  fields {
    director Text
    releaseDate Date
  }
  actions {
    get latestRelease(director) @function
  }
}
```

If this action wasn't marked as a `@function` then you would get a validation error as `director` is not a unique field, but as this is a function we can provide a custom implementation.

```typescript filename="functions/latestRelease.ts"
import { LatestRelease, models } from "@teamkeel/sdk";

export default LatestRelease({
  async beforeQuery(ctx, inputs) {
    // Find the most recent film by the provided director
    const films = await models.film.findMany({
      where: {
        director: {
          equals: inputs.director,
        },
      },
      limit: 1,
      orderBy: {
        releaseDate: 'desc',
      },
    });

    // If no films then return null
    // Note: get actions should return a record or null
    if (films.length) === 0 {
      return null;
    }

    // Return the first result
    return films[0];
  },
});
```

#### `afterQuery`

The `afterQuery` hook allows you to modify the response, perform custom permission checks, or perform side effects using the data returned from the query.

##### Arguments

- `ctx` - a context object which contains things like the authenticated Identity, environment variables and secrets, and request headers
- `inputs` - the inputs provided by the caller of your function
- `data` - the data that was retrieved from the database

##### Example: modify the response

The following example shows how `afterQuery` could modify the data returned from the function.

```typescript filename="functions/listPreviewProducts.ts"
import { ListPreviewProducts } from "@teamkeel/sdk";

export default ListPreviewProducts({
  async afterQuery(ctx, inputs, products) {
    return products.map((p) => ({
      ...p,
      // truncate the title to 10 characters if not authenticated
      title: ctx.isAuthenticated ? p.title : `${p.title.slice(0, 10)}...`,
    }));
  },
});
```

##### Example: custom permissions check

The `afterQuery` hook could also be used to add a custom permissions check, for example:

```typescript filename="functions/listProducts.ts"
import { ListProducts, permissions } from "@teamkeel/sdk";

export default ListProducts({
  async afterQuery(ctx, inputs, products) {
    const hasUnpublishedProducts = products.some((p) => !p.isPublished);

    if (hasUnpublishedProducts && !ctx.isAuthenticated) {
      // deny the request if any of the products returned are not published
      // and the request is not authenticated
      // permissions.deny() will throw an error and stop execution.
      permissions.deny();
    }

    // otherwise, just return the products in the response.
    return products;
  },
});
```

#### `beforeWrite`

The `beforeWrite` hook allows you perform side-effects or permission checks for `create`, `update`, and `delete` function. For `create` and `update` functions this hook can also be used to modify the values that will be written to the database.

##### Arguments

The arguments to `beforeWrite` are slightly different depending on the action type.

**create**

- `ctx` - a context object which contains things like the authenticated Identity, environment variables and secrets, and request headers
- `inputs` - the inputs provided by the caller of your function
- `values` - the values that will be written to the database

**update**

- `ctx` - a context object which contains things like the authenticated Identity, environment variables and secrets, and request headers
- `inputs` - the inputs provided by the caller of your function
- `values` - the _new_ values that will be written to the database
- `record` - the _existing_ record that is going to be updated

**delete**

- `ctx` - a context object which contains things like the authenticated Identity, environment variables and secrets, and request headers
- `inputs` - the inputs provided by the caller of your function
- `record` - the record that is going to be deleted

##### Example: mutate write values

The following example shows how the `beforeWrite` hook can be used to mutate the values being written to the database. Here a `summary` field is computed based on the title and the first 100 characters of the description.

```typescript filename="functions/createProduct.ts"
import { CreateProduct } from "@teamkeel/sdk";

export default CreateProduct({
  async beforeWrite(ctx, inputs, values) {
    let desc = inputs.description;
    if (desc.length > 100) {
      desc = desc.substring(0, 97) + "...";
    }
    return {
      ...values,
      summary: `${inputs.title} - ${desc}`,
    };
  },
});
```

##### Example: update based on existing values

When using this hook in an `update` function the fourth argument to the hook is the _existing_ record. The following example shows how you can use that record to update the values that will be used for the update.

```typescript filename="functions/incrementCounter.ts"
import { IncrementCounter } from "@teamkeel/sdk";

export default IncrementCounter({
  async beforeWrite(ctx, inputs, values, record) {
    return {
      ...values,
      count: record.count + inputs.value,
    };
  },
});
```

#### `afterWrite`

The `afterWrite` hook allows you to perform side effects after the record has been written to the database for `create` and `update` and after the record has been deleted for `delete`. Common use cases include creating other models and performing custom permission checks.

For `create` and `update` this hook can return a modified version of the record that was created or updated. As with `afterQuery` this only affects the data returned from the API, not the data in the database.

import { Callout } from "nextra/components";

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Although the `afterWrite` hook can be used to perform side-effects after a
  write, in many cases it will be better to use an [event](/events). The key
  difference is that the `afterWrite` hook happens as part of your action and so
  will affect the response time of your action, whereas an event happens
  _asynchronously_.
</Callout>

##### Arguments

- `ctx` - a context object which contains things like the authenticated Identity, environment variables and secrets, and request headers
- `inputs` - the inputs provided by the caller of your function
- `data` - the record that that was created/updated/deleted

##### Example: creating additional records

The following example shows how you can create additional records in the database in an `afterWrite` hook.

```typescript filename="functions/createProduct.ts"
import { CreateProduct, models } from "@teamkeel/sdk";

export default CreateProduct({
  async afterWrite(ctx, inputs, data) {
    await models.productReviews.create({
      productId: data.id,
      rating: 10,
      content: "We love it, and that's not just because we made it.",
    });
  },
});
```

##### Example: posting an update to Slack

In a `delete` function the third argument to the `afterWrite` hook is the record that was deleted. The following example shows how you could post a message to Slack whenever a product is deleted.

```typescript filename="functions/createProduct.ts"
import { DeleteProduct, models } from "@teamkeel/sdk";
import { sendSlackMessage } from "../lib/slack";

export default DeleteProduct({
  async afterWrite(ctx, inputs, data) {
    await sendSlackMessage(
      "#products",
      `${data.title} (${data.id}) has been deleted!`
    );
  },
});
```

### Named inputs

Given the following schema, we have a `get` function called `latestRelease` that takes a `director` input.

```keel filename="schema.keel"
model Film {
  fields {
    director Text
    releaseDate Date
  }
  actions {
    get latestRelease(director) @function
  }
}
```

In this case, `director` is a field on the model. Sometimes, we may need to pass inputs to functions that are not fields on the model. For example, we may want to pass a `yearLimit` input to this `get` function to find the latest release *within* a given year for directors who have released multiple films in that year.

To do this, we can add a specific input to this function that the function will receive that is not a field on the model. This is called a *named input*. We can do this like so.

```keel filename="schema.keel" {7}
model Film {
  fields {
    director Text
    releaseDate Date
  }
  actions {
    get latestRelease(director, yearLimit: Number) @function
  }
}
```

Now, the hooks for this function will receive a property called `yearLimit` on their `inputs` argument that can be used for further filtering.

```typescript filename="functions/latestRelease.ts" {11,12}
import { ListFilms } from "@teamkeel/sdk";

export default ListFilms({
  async beforeQuery(ctx, inputs, query) {
    const allFilms = await query.where({
      director: {
        endsWith: "Waititi",
      },
    });

    // filter the films by yearLimit
    const films = allFilms.filter((f) => f.releaseDate.getFullYear() <= inputs.yearLimit);

    return films;
  },
});
```

We use `inputs.yearLimit` to filter the films by the year limit provided by the caller of the function even though `yearLimit` is not necessarily a field on the model. This is the value of named inputs.

## Custom functions

There may be cases where you want to define a function that returns custom data or needs to receive unknown data as input. For these situations, you can use the `read` and `write` action types with `messages`.

### Custom inputs and responses

To illustrate how custom functions work we will create a batch create function. The built-in Keel action types do not support this, but it can be implemented using the `write` action type and messages.

```keel filename="schema.keel"
enum Genre {
  Horror
  Romance
}

model Book {
  fields {
    title Text
    genre Genre
  }
  actions {
    write createBooks(CreateBooksInput) returns (CreateBooksResponse)
  }
}
```

Actions that use the `read` or `write` type must take a `message` as input and use the `returns` keyword to define the response message. The following example demonstrates how to define the messages we used in the `createBooks` action.

```keel filename="schema.keel"
message CreateBooksInput {
  // messages can be nested
  books CreateBooksBookFields[]
}

message CreateBooksBookFields {
  title Text
  // messages can contain enums
  genre Genre
}

message CreateBooksResponse {
  // messages can contain models
  books Book[]
}
```

Messages are defined using the `message` keyword and have the same syntax as the `fields` block in a [model](/models) definition. Message fields can be other messages, models, enums, or built-in Keel types.

<Callout>
  Message names must be **UpperCamelCase** and must be distinct from any model
  or enum name.
</Callout>

There is nothing really different about the code for functions that use messages, and they will still be correctly typed. The implementation for `createBooks` might look like this.

```tsx filename="functions/createBooks.ts"
import { CreateBooks, models } from "@teamkeel/sdk";

export default CreateBooks(async (ctx, input) => {
  const books = await Promise.all(
    input.books.map((fields) => {
      return models.book.create({
        title: fields.title,
        genre: fields.genre,
      });
    })
  );

  return {
    books,
  };
});
```

### The `Any` message

The built-in message `Any` can be used as the input or response of a `read` or `write` function. When you use this message the inputs or return type of your function will be the TypeScript type `any`. The `Any` message is useful if you want to receive unknown or arbitrary data in your function or return dynamic data.

### Permissions

For custom `read` or `write` functions you must implement any permissions logic in your code. This can be done by importing the `permissions` from the `@teamkeel/sdk` package and using the `allow()` and `deny()` methods.

```tsx filename="functions/createBooks.ts"
import { permissions } from "@teamkeel/sdk";

export default CustomAction(async (ctx, input) => {
  if (ctx.headers.get("X-custom-auth-header") == ctx.secrets.AUTH_KEY) {
    permissions.allow();
  } else {
    return;
  }

  // checking row level access
  if (item.owner != ctx.identity.id) {
    permissions.deny();
  }
});
```

By default, functions will return permission denied until `allow()` is called so `deny()` only needs to be called if you are explicitly denying access in your code after an `allow()` call.


## Using the database

The `@teamkeel/sdk` package is generated based on your schema and contains type-safe APIs for interacting with your models. These APIs are all available on the exported `models` object.

See [Model API](/functions/sdk/modelApi) for full usage.

### Low-level database API

If you need more complex database operations you can use the [Database API](/functions/sdk/databaseApi) to write custom queries.

## Using `fetch`

We deploy your functions into an environment running Node.js 18.x, which means the Fetch API is available globally.

One example of using `fetch` is to proxy API calls to a 3rd party service through your Keel APIs. This is often useful if the API you want to use requires an API key and you don't want to expose that to your frontend.

The following example uses the special `Any` message type to allow any input and any response from the `doSomething` function:

```keel filename="schema.keel"
model MyThing {
  actions {
    read doSomething(Any) returns (Any)
  }
}
```

The function implementation calls the 3rd party API, pass the API token, and return its response.

```tsx filename="functions/doSomething.ts"
import { DoSomething } from "@teamkeel/sdk";

export default DoSomething(async (ctx, inputs) => {
  // make an API call to 3rd party
  const res = await fetch("https://some-cool-api.com", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      // use a secret to store your API token
      "Api-Token": ctx.secrets.API_TOKEN,
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      some: "param",
    }),
  });

  // return the response as JSON
  return res.json();
});
```

## Using Headers

You can access request headers by using `ctx.headers`, which is a _read-only_ version of the [`Headers`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Headers) object, and you can set response headers by using `ctx.response.headers` which is a normal `Headers` object.

```tsx filename="functions/myFunction.ts"
export default MyFunction((inputs, api, ctx) => {
  // read a request header
  const reqHeader = ctx.headers.get("X-My-Custom-Header");

  // write a response header
  ctx.response.headers.set("X-My-Other-Header", "1234");
});
```

## HTTP Status Codes

You can set the HTTP status code of the response from your function, which is useful if you want to return a redirect response from your action.

import { Tab, Tabs } from "nextra-theme-docs";

<Tabs items={['Function', 'Schema']}>
  <Tab>
```tsx filename="functions/myRedirectFunction.ts"
import { MyRedirectFunction } from "@teamkeel/sdk"

export default MyRedirectFunction((inputs, api, ctx) => {
  // do some stuff...

  // return a redirect
  ctx.response.headers.set("Location", "https://some.url.com/");
  ctx.response.status = 302;
  return null;
});

````
  </Tab>
   <Tab>
```keel filename="schema.keel"
model MyModel {
  actions {
    write myRedirectFunction(Any) returns (Any)
  }
}
````

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Setting the HTTP response status code will only have an affect on your JSON
API endpoints, so in the above example `/json/api/myRedirectFunction` will
return a redirect response but using `myRedirectFunction` via [GraphQL](/apis/graphql) or
[JSON-RPC](/apis#json-rpc) APIs will not.

## Environment Variables and Secrets

Environment variables defined in your `keelconfig.yaml` {/* 👈 @todo in a future PR */} file will be available in your functions by using `ctx.env`, which is typed according to the environment variables you've defined in your config file. No more un-typed `process.env` 🎉

In much the same way, any secret you define in your `keelconfig.yaml` file will be available on `ctx.secrets`, which is also typed. As secrets are sensitive values they are not set as environment variables and are only accessible by using `ctx.secrets`.

As an example if we have the following `keelconfig.yaml` file

```yaml filename="keelconfig.yaml"
environment:
  default:
    - name: MY_ENV_VAR
      value: "some-value"
secrets:
	- name: MY_SECRET
```

We could then access these in a function like so

```tsx filename="functions/myFunction.ts"
export default MyFunction(async (ctx, inputs) => {
  ctx.env.MY_ENV_VAR; // "some-value"
  ctx.secrets.MY_SECRET; // will be decrypted secret value

  // TypeScript will catch this with the error:
  // ts(2339) Property 'FOO' does not exist on type 'Environment'.
  ctx.env.FOO;

  // TypeScript will catch this with the error:
  // ts(2339) Property 'FOO' does not exist on type 'Secrets'.
  ctx.secrets.FOO;
});
```
