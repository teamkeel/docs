# Functions

Functions allow you to implement actions using code, but they are so much more than just "serverless functions". Your functions are deeply integrated into your app, meaning that inputs are validated, authentication and permissions are handled for you, and you have full access to your database.

We currently support TypeScript for writing functions and your function code should be located in the `functions` directory of your project, with each function in its own file named the same as the function in the schema. So if you have a function called `doTheThing` in your schema, the code for this function would be located at `functions/doTheThing.ts`.

## A simple function

Functions can use the same action types as actions, for example `get`, `list` and so on. To make a built-in action a function, we apply the `@function` attribute. To illustrate how functions work lets implement a simple `get` function. 

```keel filename="schema.keel"
model Product {
  actions {
    get getProduct(id) @function
  }
}
```

If we then run `keel generate` a function file will be created for us which will look something like this.

```tsx filename="functions/getProduct.ts"
import { GetProduct } from "@teamkeel/sdk";

// To learn more about what you can do with hooks,
// visit https://docs.keel.so/functions
const hooks : GetProductHooks = {};

export default GetProduct(hooks);
```

The `@teamkeel/sdk` package is auto-generated based on your schema and contains wrapper functions for each of your schema-defined functions. These wrapper functions ensure that your code is correctly typed without having to explicitly declare types.

Functions have a default implementation that works out of the box, without you having to write any extra code. For example, if we pass `id` in the inputs in the request to the action, the function will automatically query the database to find a product matching that `id`.

Obviously this example is very simple, and in practice this kind of action wouldn't need to be annotated with the `@function` attribute in our schema, unless you require your action to do more than just query the database to find the product by its ID.

## Hooks

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  If you have an existing schema that predates the introduction of **Hooks** please read the [Migration Guide](/functions/hooks/migration-guide)
</Callout>


**Hooks** allow you to modify the default behaviour of the function; for example you might want to add constraints to the query, run custom permission logic on the returned rows, create related data, or perform other side effects.

### `beforeWrite`

The `beforeWrite` hook allows you to modify the values that will be written to the database.

An example might be where we want to change the value of the `title` of a `Product` to include the product's Stock Keeping Unit (SKU):

```typescript filename="createProduct.ts"
import { CreateProduct } from "@teamkeel/sdk";

export default CreateProduct({
  beforeWrite: async (ctx, inputs) => {
    return {
      ...inputs,
      title: `${inputs.title} (${inputs.sku})`
    };
  }
});
```

#### Arguments

`beforeWrite` receives two arguments.

- `ctx` - a context object which contains things like the authenticated Identity, environment variables and secrets, and request headers
- `inputs` - the inputs provided by the caller of your function

#### Return type

`beforeWrite` expects the hook to return the model object.

In the case of the example, the return type is expected to be `Product`.

### `afterWrite`

The `afterWrite` hook allows you to perform side effects after the record has been written to the database. Common use cases include creating other models, and performing custom permission checks.

An example `afterWrite` hook that performs some side effects might be:

```typescript filename="createProduct.ts"
import { CreateProduct, models } from "@teamkeel/sdk";

export default CreateProduct({
  afterWrite: async (ctx, inputs, data) => {
    await models.productReviews.create({
      productId: data.id,
      rating: 10,
      content: "We love it, and that's not just because we made it." 
    });
  }
});
```

#### Arguments

`afterWrite` receives two arguments.

- `ctx` - a context object which contains things like the authenticated Identity, environment variables and secrets, and request headers
- `inputs` - the inputs provided by the caller of your function
- `data` - the data that was written to the database, including the `id`

#### Return type

`afterWrite` does not expect a value to be returned from the hook.

### `beforeQuery`

The `beforeQuery` hook allows you to modify the behaviour of the default query that is executed if no `beforeQuery` hook has been defined.

There are two ways you can use `beforeQuery`:

#### Extending the existing query

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  For `update` actions, we do not currently support extending the existing query, so you should follow the _Replacing the query entirely_ section below.
</Callout>

By default, a query will be built up based on the `where` conditions passed in the `inputs` to the function.

For example, given the following inputs to a `list` action:

```json
{
  "where": {
    "title": {
      "startsWith": "star wars"
    }
  }
}
```

If you define a `beforeQuery` hook, this will look like:

```typescript filename="listProducts.ts"
import { ListProducts } from "@teamkeel/sdk";

export default ListProducts({
  beforeQuery: (ctx, inputs, query) => {
    // some code
  }
});
```

The third parameter to the hook `query` is an instance of our `QueryBuilder` class with the `where` constraints from the inputs already applied. Without any additional mutation of the query object, the SQL that will be generated and run against the database will look something like:

```sql
SELECT * FROM product WHERE product.title LIKE 'star wars%'
```

So in your `beforeQuery` hook above, if you were to add the following code:

```typescript filename="listProducts.ts"
import { ListProducts } from "@teamkeel/sdk";

export default ListProducts({
  beforeQuery: (ctx, inputs, query) => {
    return query.where({
      title: {
        endsWith: 'phantom menace'
      }
    });
  }
});
```

The final SQL would be:

```sql
SELECT * FROM product WHERE product.title LIKE 'star wars%' AND product.title LIKE '%phantom menace'
```

#### Replacing the query entirely

<Callout type="info">
  `beforeQuery` hooks on `update` actions should use this approach.
</Callout>

Alternatively, the return type of `beforeQuery` also allows you to return a `Promise<T>` where `T` is the current model. So in the case of our example schema, and implementing a `list` action, this would be a `Promise<Product[]>`.

You can use our [Model API](/functions/sdk/modelApi) to write your own custom query implementation, although you will have to handle all of the inputs to the action yourself (as shown in the example below), as the built-in behaviour will no longer take place:

```typescript filename="listProducts.ts"
import { ListProducts, models } from "@teamkeel/sdk";

export default ListProducts({
  beforeQuery: async (ctx, inputs) => {
    const products = await models.product.findMany({
      where: {
        ...inputs.where,
        isPublished: true,
      }
    });

    return products;
  }
});
```

### `afterQuery`

The `afterQuery` hook allows you to modify the response, perform custom permission checks, or perform side effects using the data returned from the query.

An example `afterQuery` hook might be:

```typescript filename="ListPreviewProducts.ts"
import { ListPreviewProducts } from "@teamkeel/sdk";

export default ListPreviewProducts({
  afterQuery: async (ctx, inputs, products) => {
    return products.map(p => ({
      ...p,
      // truncate the title to 10 characters if not authenticated
      title: ctx.isAuthenticated ? p.title : `${p.title.slice(0, 10)}...`
    }))
  }
});
```

An example `afterQuery` hook that performs some custom permissions logic might look like:

```typescript filename="ListPreviewProducts.ts"
import { ListPreviewProducts, permissions } from "@teamkeel/sdk";

export default ListPreviewProducts({
  afterQuery: async (ctx, inputs, products) => {
    const hasUnpublishedProducts = products.some(p => !p.isPublished);

    if (hasUnpublishedProducts && !ctx.isAuthenticated) {
      // deny the request if any of the products returned are not published
      // and the request is not authenticated
      // permissions.deny() will throw an error and stop execution.
      permissions.deny();
    }

    // otherwise, just return the products in the response.
    return products;
  }
});
```


#### Arguments

`afterQuery` receives two arguments.

- `ctx` - a context object which contains things like the authenticated Identity, environment variables and secrets, and request headers
- `inputs` - the inputs provided by the caller of your function
- `data` - the data that was retrieved from the database

#### Return type

`afterQuery` expects the hook to return the model (or array of model in the case of a `list` action).

In the example above, the expected return type will be `Promise<Product[]>`.

## Using the database

The `@teamkeel/sdk` package is generated based on your schema and contains type-safe API's for interacting with your models. These APIs are all available on the exported `models` object.

See [Model API](/functions/sdk/modelApi) for full usage.

### Custom database queries

If you need more complex database operations you can use the [Database API](/functions/sdk/databaseApi) to write custom queries.

## Using `fetch`

We deploy your functions into an environment running Node.js 18.x, which means the Fetch API is available.

One example of using `fetch` is to proxy API calls to a 3rd party service through your Keel APIs. This is often useful if the API you want to use requires an API key and you don't want to expose that to your frontend.

The following example uses the special `Any` message type to allow any input and any response from the `doSomething` function.

```keel filename="schema.keel"
model MyThing {
  actions {
    read doSomething(Any) returns (Any)
  }
}
```

The function implementation calls the 3rd party API, passing the API token, and return its response.

```tsx filename="functions/doSomething.ts"
import {DoSomething} from "@teamkeel/sdk";

export default DoSomething(async (ctx, inputs) => {
  // make an API call to 3rd party
  const res = await fetch("https://some-cool-api.com", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      // use a secret to store your API token
      "Api-Token": ctx.secrets.API_TOKEN,
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      some: "param",
    }),
  });

  // return the response as JSON
  return res.json();
});
```

## Using Headers

You can access request headers by using `ctx.headers`, which is a *read-only* version of the `[Headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Headers)` object, and you can set response headers by using `ctx.response.headers` which is a normal [`Headers`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Headers) object.

```tsx filename="functions/myFunction.ts"
export default MyFunction((inputs, api, ctx) => {
  // read a request header
  const reqHeader = ctx.headers.get("X-My-Custom-Header");

  // write a response header
  ctx.response.headers.set("X-My-Other-Header", "1234");
});
```

## Environment Variables and Secrets

Any environment variables you've defined in your `keelconfig.yaml` file will be available in your functions by using `ctx.env`, which is typed according to the environment variables you've defined in your config file. No more un-typed `process.env` 🎉

In much the same way, any secrets you've defined in your `keelconfig.yaml` file will be available on `ctx.secrets`, which is also typed. As secrets are sensitive values they are not set as environment variables and are only accessible by using `ctx.secrets`.

As an example if we have the following `keelconfig.yaml` file.

```yaml filename="keelconfig.yaml"
environment:
  default:
    - name: MY_ENV_VAR
      value: "some-value"
secrets:
	- name: MY_SECRET
```

We could then access these in a function like so.

```tsx filename="functions/myFunction.ts"
export default MyFunction(async (ctx, inputs) => {
  ctx.env.MY_ENV_VAR // "some-value"
  ctx.secrets.MY_SECRET // will be decrypted secret value

  // TypeScript will catch this with the error:
  // ts(2339) Property 'FOO' does not exist on type 'Environment'.
  ctx.env.FOO

  // TypeScript will catch this with the error:
  // ts(2339) Property 'FOO' does not exist on type 'Secrets'.
  ctx.secrets.FOO
});
```

## Custom functions

There may be cases where you want to define a function that returns custom data or needs to receive unknown data as input. For these situations, you can use the `read` and `write` action types with **messages**.

### Custom inputs and responses

To illustrate how custom functions work we will create a batch create function. The built-in Keel action types do not support this, but it can be implemented using the `write` action type and messages.

```keel filename="schema.keel"
enum Genre {
  Horror
  Romance
}

model Book {
  fields {
    title Text
    genre Genre
  }
  actions {
    write createBooks(CreateBooksInput) returns (CreateBooksResponse)
  }
}
```

Actions that use the `read` or `write` type must take a message as input and use the `returns` keyword to define the response message. The following example demonstrates how to define the messages we used in the `createBooks` action.

```keel filename="schema.keel"
message CreateBooksInput {
  // messages can be nested
  books CreateBooksBookFields[]
}

message CreateBooksBookFields {
  title Text
  // messages can contain enums
  genre Genre
}

message CreateBooksResponse {
  // messages can contain models
  books Book[]
}
```

Messages are defined using the `message` keyword and have the same syntax as the `fields` block in a model definition. Message fields can be other messages, models, enums, or built-in Keel types.

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

<Callout>
  Message names must be **UpperCamelCase** and must be distinct from any model or enum name.
</Callout>

There is nothing really different about the code for functions that use messages, and they will still be correctly typed. The implementation for `createBooks` might look like this.

```tsx filename="functions/createBooks.ts"
import { CreateBooks, models } from "@teamkeel/sdk";

export default CreateBooks(async (ctx, input) => {
  const books = await Promise.all(
    input.books.map((fields) => {
      return models.book.create({
        title: fields.title,
        genre: fields.genre,
      });
    })
  );

  return {
    books,
  };
});
```

### The `Any` message

The built-in message `Any` can be used as the input or response of a `read` or `write` function. When you use this message the inputs or return type of your function will be the TypeScript type `any`. The `Any` message is useful if you want to receive unknown or arbitrary data in your function or return dynamic data.


### Permissions

For custom `read` or `write` functions you must implement any permissions logic in your code. This can be done by importing the `permissions` from the `@teamkeel/sdk` package and using the `allow()` and `deny()` methods.

```tsx filename="functions/createBooks.ts"
import { permissions } from "@teamkeel/sdk";

export default CustomAction(async (ctx, input) => {

  if (ctx.headers.get("X-custom-auth-header") == ctx.secrets.AUTH_KEY) {
    permissions.allow()
  } else {
    return
  }

  // checking row level access
  if (item.owner != ctx.identity.id) {
    permissions.deny()
  }

});
```

By default, functions will return permission denied until `allow()` is called so `deny()` only needs to be called if you are explicitly denying access in your code after an `allow()` call.
