# Linked fields

Linked fields are id fields that you can click on to view all of the data for that entry. It will prefill the id input for the `get` action with the id that you have clicked on and fetch the data.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  ID fields will only appear linked if you have a `get` action in your schema for that id's model.
</Callout>

For the below example, when an `Author` entry is fetched, you will see an "agent id" field returned. The `id` will be linked to the `getAgent` action so that you can view all of the book data.

```keel
model Author {
    fields {
        name Text
        books Book[]
        agent Agent?
    }

    actions {
        get getAuthor(id) 
    }
}

model Agent {
    fields {
        name Text
    }

    actions {
        get getAgent(id) 
    }
}
```
