## Building the Backend with Keel

Our application is simple, we want to be able to create a new user, assign a role to that user and see it reflected in the database. To do this, we need to define our schema in a `schema.keel` file like so:

```keel
enum UserRole {
    Customer
    Vendor
}

model User {
    fields {
        identity Identity
        name Text
        role UserRole @default(UserRole.Customer)
    }

    actions {
        create createUser() with (name, role) {
            @set(user.identity = ctx.identity)
            @permission(expression: ctx.isAuthenticated)
        }
    }
}
```

In our schema, we have created an [enum](https://docs.keel.so/models#enums) for the user roles. Enums in Keel are a named set of values, which are useful when you want very specific options in a particular field.

Our [model](https://docs.keel.so/models) `User` has the following fields:

- [Identity](https://docs.keel.so/identity): holds the logged-in user identity
- `name`: holds the name of the user
- `role`: holds the `UserRole` enum and we have specified the default option for the field to be `Customer`

For [actions](https://docs.keel.so/actions), we have a single `create` action called `createUser` which allows you to create a new user with a name and a role. We have also set the identity of the user to be the logged-in user identity.
For [Permission](https://docs.keel.so/permissions), we have specified that the `createUser` action can be carried out by any authenticated user.

Now that we have defined our schema, all we need to do is head over to the [Keel console](https://console.keel.xyz), create a new project by selecting a blank project in the Keel console and deploy our backend on Keel by making a push to the generated GitHub repository.

With your backend deployed on Keel, head over to the API explorer tab and grab your API endpoint. For the purpose of this tutorial, we’ll be using the JSON API.

 Keel provides APIs for you in three formats, namely:
- [JSON](https://docs.keel.so/apis/json)
- [GraphQL](https://docs.keel.so/apis/graphql)
- [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/)
</Callout>

### Generating the Keel Client

As well as using the APIs directly in three forms, we can generate a typescript client for our frontend project so that we can easily work with your APIs with full end-to-end type safety. We can do that by running the following command in the folder where our Keel schema is present:

```bash
keel client
```

The above command will automatically create a new file called `keelClient.ts` in the root folder, we’ll need this file when working on the front end.
