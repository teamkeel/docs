# Identity

Almost every application requires authentication and for this purpose Keel comes with a built-in `Identity` model. This model represents the different **identities** that have **authenticated** with your app and includes a few actions that can be used to build authentication into your product.

import { Callout } from "nextra/components";

<Callout type="info">
  We now support integration with 3rd-party authentication providers, and will be deprecating the `authenticate` action that ships with the `Identity` model.
</Callout>

## Usage in models

Since `Identity` is a regular model, you can use it as a relationship field. A common use-case for this is to add `Identity` to the model that represents **users** in your application. For instance, you might add `Identity` to a `Customer` model.

```keel
model Customer {
  fields {
    identity Identity @unique
  }
}
```

When using `Identity` like this you will probably want to **mark the field as unique**, so that an identity relates to a single customer.

## Usage in expressions

When writing an expression in your schema or writing a function, `ctx.identity` refers to the currently **authenticated** `Identity`. If the caller of an action is not authenticated then `ctx.identity` will be null.

### Filtering records by Identity

It is common to want to make APIs that only return data owned by the caller. This can be done in a Keel app by filtering the returned records by the authenticated `Identity`. As an example in the following schema there is a `myPosts` action that only returns the posts created by a profile that is linked to the calling Identity.

```keel {3,10,14}
model Profile {
  fields {
    identity Identity @unique
    posts Post[]
  }
}

model Post {
  fields {
    profile Profile
  }
  actions {
    list myPosts() {
      @where(post.profile.identity == ctx.identity)
    }
  }
}
```

Note that filtering records like this is different from defining [**permissions**](/permissions).

### Setting a field to the callers Identity

When `Identity` is used in a model as a relationship field, you should always use `ctx.identity` to set it, rather than trying to accept it as an input (which won't work).

```keel
model Profile {
  fields {
    identity Identity @unique
  }
  actions {
    create createProfile() {
      @set(profile.identity = ctx.identity)
    }
  }
}
```

### Permissions

You can use `ctx.identity` in a permission expression to restrict who is allowed to perform certain actions.

```keel {22}
model Profile {
  fields {
    identity Identity @unique
  }
}

model Post {
  fields {
    profile Profile
  }

  actions {
    get getPost(id)
    delete deletePost(id)
  }

  @permission(
    expression: true,
    actions: [get]
  )

  @permission(
    expression: post.profile.identity == ctx.identity,
    actions: [delete]
  )
}
```
