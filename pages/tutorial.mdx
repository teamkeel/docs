# Tutorial

This tutorial will walk you through the basics of Keel by building a backend for a Todo app.

We'll cover modelling your data, creating an API with authentication and permissions, writing some custom code and then finally we'll connect it all up to a front end. All in less than 30 mins - let's go!

## Setup

You'll need a couple of things to follow along

- A Github account
- VS Code
- A git client (e.g command line, Github Desktop, VS Code Git)

To start, create a new project on Keel by going to [console.keel.xyz](http://console.keel.xyz) and selecting the example project which is the starting point for our todo backend.

### Cloning the repo
Once you reach the final step of the onboading you should see the git URL of your new repo. The next step is to clone the repo to your local machine and install the VSCode extension.

import { Tab, Tabs } from 'nextra-theme-docs'

<Tabs items={['Using git CLI', 'Using Github Desktop app']}>
  <Tab>
Copy the command directly from the final step of the project setup e.g.

```bash
git clone git@github.com/{yourUsername}/{projectName}
```
  </Tab>
    <Tab>
Click **add → Clone Repository** and then select the newly created repo

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Installing VSCode exension

The Keel VSCode extension provides sytax highlighting and inline validation of Keel schema files. You can install it by going to the **Extensions** tab in VSCode and searching for Keel.

![VSCode Extension](/vscode-extension.png)

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

  The extension only works in the app version of VS Code and not in a browser.
</Callout>

### Review
Once you've got the project set up locally you'll see two things in the project:

- A `schema.keel` file
- A `functions` directory

We'll start by looking at the schema.

## The Keel schema

A Keel schema is the blueprint for your backend. It describes your data models, actions that can be taken on those models, permission rules that specify who is allowed to perform those actions, and how they get exposed as APIs.

Let's walk through `schema.keel`

</Callout>

### Models & fields

A Keel app is all built around your data, and you describe your data using models. To start with we have a model called `Todo` with a selection of fields:

```keel
model Todo {
    fields {
        title Text
        complete Boolean @default(false)
        description Text?
        completedAt Timestamp?
        owner Identity
        project Project?
    }
}
```

Fields are the information we store for that model and are defined with a name and a field type. The `?` on the type indicates that this value can be null. The `owner` and `project` fields have another model name as their type which indicates that these are relationships to another model which we'll come back to in a bit.

### Built-in fields

All models have `id`, `createdAt`, and `updatedAt` fields that are always present. You can think of them as if they were defined in every model like this:

```keel
model Todo {
    fields {
        id ID # a unique id for a record
        createdAt Timestamp # The time a record was created
        updatedAt Timestamp # The time a record was last updated
    }
}
```

</Callout>

### Actions

There are two types of **Actions** that can be defined on a model; built-in actions are automatically generated by Keel, whereas functions are written by you, in code.

```keel
model Todo {
    actions {
        get todo(id)
        list allTodos(complete?, project.id?) {
            @where(todo.owner == ctx.identity)
        }
        delete deleteTodo(id)
        update updateTodo(id) with (title?, description?, project.id?)
        create createTodo() with (title, description?, project.id?) {
            @set(todo.owner = ctx.identity)
        }
        update setCompletion(id) with (complete) @function
    }
}
```

This tutorial doesn't cover functions, but you can read more about them in the [Function](/functions) docs.

A key thing to note here is that Keel doesn't automatically generate CRUD actions for models. All actions are explicitly defined in your schema, which gives you full control in designing your APIs.

All actions have an action type (e.g. `get` `list` etc), a name and a set of inputs. The first set of parenthesis are the read inputs (used to filter the results), and if the operation is a write operation, a second set of parenthesis after the `with` keyword defines the write inputs (used to update or create records).

### Permissions

The Todo model also defines some permission rules. These rules are defined using the `@permission` attribute and describe who has permission to perform actions. Keel APIs are secure-by-default, and you have to explicitly define permission rules in your schema.

```keel {9-12}
model Todo {
	actions {
        create createTodo() with (title, description?, project.id?) {
            @permission(expression: ctx.isAuthenticated)
            @set(todo.owner = ctx.identity)
        }
    }

    @permission(
        actions: [get, list, update, delete],
        expression: todo.owner == ctx.identity
    )
}
```

Permissions can be defined inside a model or an action, and can use a logical expression or a role (roles are not covered in this tutorial). If you use an expression it is evaluated for **each row** on which the action acts, and if it evaluates to `true` for every row then the user is allowed to perform the action, otherwise they are not.

If the `@permission` attribute is used directly inside a model then you must say which actions type it applies to, if defined inside an action this argument should not be provided.

While more than one `@permission` can be defined on a model and its actions, **only one needs to be satisfied** in order to allow access to an action.

For the Todo model we have two permissions rules:

1. Any `get`, `list`, `update` and `delete` actions can only be performed if the `ctx.identity` (which is the identity of the current authenticated user) must match the value stored in the `owner` field of the entry
2. The `createTodo` operation can be performed by anyone as long as they are logged in

You can find out more about permissions in the [Permissions](/permissions) docs.

### The Project model

The Project model should now look rather familiar as you know how the `field` and `actions` blocks work as well as the `@permission` attributes.

```keel
model Project {
    fields {
        title Text
        owner Identity
        tasks Todo[]
    }

    actions {
        get getProject(id)
        list listProjects() {
            @where(project.owner == ctx.identity)
        }
        delete deleteProject(id)
        create createProject() with (title) {
            @permission(expression: ctx.isAuthenticated)
            @set(project.owner = ctx.identity)
        }
        update updateProject(id) with (title)
    }

    @permission(
        actions: [get, list, update, delete],
        expression: project.owner == ctx.identity
    )
}
```

Let's focus in on one field - `tasks`.

The type of this field is `Todo[]`, which mean it's a relationship to the `Todo` model and there can be many todo entries linked to one project.

If we look at the Todo model we can see that the `project` field has the type `Project?` which means it's an **optional** link to a project.

```keel
model Todo {
    fields {
        project Project?
    }
}
```

These fields define both sides of a one to many relationship - **one** project has **many** todos and **one** todo can belong to only **one** project. You can read more about relationships in the [Models](/models) docs.

### APIs

```keel
api Web {
    models {
        Todo
        Project
    }
}
```

At the bottom of the schema we have the API block. This is where you defined the APIs and which models they expose. In this example we're creating an API called `Web` and it exposes both the models we have in the schema. You can have as many APIs as you want in your schema and every API is available to use in three flavours: GraphQL, JSON-HTTP, and JSON-RPC.

In this case we want everything in our schema exposed in a single API, but you may want to split things out and have a customer facing API and an admin API with different models in each.

## Keel console

Now that you have got the hang of how a Keel schema works, let's pop back to the console and see what gets built from that schema.

Click **Done** to close the new project flow and you'll land on your project overview.

![Project overview in Keel console](/tutorial-console.png)

Here you'll see the details of the commit that's currently live, the urls of your deployed API(s) and a live overview of traffic to your APIs.

Opening up the **Schema visualiser** in the main navigation, you'll see a visual representation of the data model we just looked at in the schema file and how different models and fields relate to each other.

![Schema visualiser](/tutorial-schema.png)

Finally head to the **API explorer** to see generated docs for all actions in your schema and the how to access them. We'll use these docs to hit our API later on.

## Developing your Schema

Now we've gone on a whistle stop tour of the todo app schema and console, it's time to add some features. Imagine our todo app needs some basic future planning tools and a way to review the past week.

Here's a quick list of what we'll need:

- Add a due date for a todo
- Create an operation to list todos due Today

Let's take this one step at a time.

### Adding a Due Date field

First, let's add an optional `dueDate` field. Our current Todo model was created with the following fields:

```keel {9} filename="schema.keel"
 model Todo {
    fields {
        complete Boolean @default(false)
        title Text
        description Text?
        completedAt Timestamp?
        owner Identity
        project Project?
        dueDate Date?
    }
 }
```

We've used `Date` instead of `Timestamp` to define the `dueDate` as we only want to store a date with no time component.

### Updating existing actions

We want to be able to set the dueDate when we create the todo and also update it. So let's add it to the `create` and `update` actions.

By adding a `?` on the end of the input we are saying that this field doesn't have to be passed in the action e.g. you can update the `title` of a todo without providing a `dueDate` value.

```keel /dueDate?/ filename="schema.keel"
model Todo {
    actions {
        get todo(id)
        list allTodos(complete?, project.id?) {
            @where(todo.owner == ctx.identity)
        }
        delete deleteTodo(id)
        update updateTodo(id) with (title?, dueDate?, description?, project.id?)
        create createTodo() with (title, dueDate?, description?, project.id?) {
            @permission(expression: ctx.isAuthenticated)
            @set(todo.owner = ctx.identity)
        }
    }
}
```

### Adding a new action

With due dates in place, we can start working on some list actions based on this field. Let's add an action that only lists todo items that are due today.

We want to return multiple entries so this is a `list` operation. We want the user of this action to be able to specify the due date they want to filter by so they can see what todo's are due today or this week. To do that we can add `dueDate` as an input.

```keel {3} filename="schema.keel"
model Todo {
    actions {
        list dueBy(dueDate)
    }
}
```

When we add an input like this which has the same name as a field on the model Keel understands what it's for and you don't need to do anything else. A user of this action would be able to filter on the `dueDate` field like this:

```json
// POST /myApi/json/dueBy

{
  "where": {
    "dueDate": {
      "after": "2023-02-21",

	    // Or any of these
      "before": "2023-02-21",
      "equals": "2023-02-21",
      "onOrAfter": "2023-02-21",
      "onOrBefore": "2023-02-21"
    }
  }
}
```

### Deploy your change

Commit your changes and push your main branch. This will trigger a build and a deploy to your staging environment. If you open up the **Build** section of the console you'll be able to see when this is complete and your changes are live.

Open up the API Explorer to see the docs for your new `dueBy` operation!

## Testing the API

Head to the **API explorer** section of the console to see the docs for your API. On the right has side you'll see the requests structure for each API protocol.

Go to the **Run** tab to query your APIs directly the console.

<Callout type="info" emoji="📖">
  If you're familiar with GraphQL you can use the built in GraphiQL playground from within the **API Explorer.**
  You can also use a REST API client to test your JSON API without the Keel console if you wish.
</Callout>

### Authenticating

As we've added permission rules to secure the API, we'll need to first authenticate to be able to call any actions. To authenticate with an API you pass a JWT (JSON Web Token) with the request.

From within the **API explorer**, tap on **Not Authenticated** on the top right to sign up / login to your API. This makes a call to the built-in `authenticate` endpoint and then uses that token for all requests in the explorer.

### Use your API

Now you're all set with API definitions and authenticated create some todos with the `createTodo` action and then use your new `dueBy` action to list them.

## Connect to a Frontend

Let's get your API connected to a frontend. **Toodooey** is a frontend for the example project. Let's give it a try!

Hop on over to - https://toodooey.netlify.app/ and enter your API url. You can find the URLs for your apis on the API explorer page. This frontend uses GraphQL so use the url that ends with `/{apiName}/graphql`

![Toodooey Todo App](/tutorial-toodooey.png)

Once you've set the url you'll reach the login screen. This is a combined login/signup so enter an email and password to sign up or enter existing details to login.
