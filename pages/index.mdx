# Keel Documentation

Welcome to the Keel documentation, your comprehensive guide to the all-in-one backend platform.

If you're new and eager to jump in quickly, start with our [quickstart](/quickstart) guide to set up your development environment. The rest of our documentation here should guide you toward learning how to leverage Keel to rapidly build your scalable product.

## AI assistance

We've built an AI assistant called [KeelGPT](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-0xwNB1Azt-keelgpt) to help you build on Keel. With it, you can:

- Create Keel schemas with Generative AI
- Get help on your existing schemas
- Ask for help on any Keel topic

To use this assistant you do need to be a ChatGPT Plus subscriber.

## Join the Community

We've got a community on Discord where users ask for help, drop ideas, or share what they're building on Keel. We invite you to [join us there](https://keel.so/discord).

## Email Support

We're also available over email. For direct assistance, email us at [support@keel.so](mailto:support@keel.so).
