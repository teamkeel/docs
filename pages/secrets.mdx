# Secrets

Every app has secrets - API keys, passwords, credentials etc... Managing secrets can be a bit of a pain, so we've built secret management into Keel that is both secure and easy to to use.

  For non-sensitive configuration values use [environment variables](/envvars).
</Callout>

## Defining Secrets

Secrets are defined in a `keelconfig.yaml` file which should be in the root of your project.

```yaml filename="keelconfig.yaml"
secrets:
  - name: MY_SECRET
  - name: MY_OTHER_SECRET
```

### Names

Secrets must be named in UPPER_SNAKE_SNAKE and cannot start with the prefix `KEEL_`. In the `keelconfig.yaml` file you only provide the names of your secrets - this is enough to enable type-safe access of your secrets in your schema and your functions.


### Values

For deployed environments you can set secret values in the console by going to the **Secrets** section in the console.

<Callout type="info"  >
  Secret values are set separately for _each_ environment, however you don't need to set a value in _every_ environment if you don't need to.
</Callout>

## Using Secrets

There are two ways you will use your secrets - from your Keel schema or from your function code.

### From a Keel schema

Secrets can be accessed with `ctx.secrets.MY_SECRET` from within any expression in your schema.

```keel {7} filename="schema.keel"
model Person {
    fields {
        name Text
    }

    @permission(
      expression: ctx.headers.API_KEY == ctx.secrets.API_KEY,
      actions: [get]
    )
}
```

### From a function

You can access your secrets in a **type-safe way** through the `ctx` argument that is passed to your functions, for example `ctx.secrets.MY_SECRET`.

```tsx filename="functions/myFunction.ts"
export default MyFunction(async (ctx, inputs) => {
  // "some-vale"
  ctx.env.MY_SECRET

  // TypeScript will catch this with the error:
  // ts(2339) Property 'FOO' does not exist on type 'Secrets'.
  ctx.env.FOO
});
```

## Secrets in development

The Keel CLI comes with a set of commands that help you manage secrets in your development environment (for example when using `keel run` to run your app locally).

### Setting secrets
To set a secret value for use in development, you can use `keel secrets set`. For example:

```bash
keel secrets set MY_SECRET 'my-value'
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="💡">
  Make sure to run `keel generate` after adding a secret, for ctx.secrets to recognise the new field
</Callout>

### Removing secrets
To remove a secret value, you can use `keel secrets remove`. For example:

```bash
keel secrets remove MY_SECRET
```

### Listing secrets
To view all secrets set in your development environment, you can use `keel secrets list`. For example:

```bash
keel secrets list
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="💡">
  To manage secrets used in the `test` environment, all the CLI secrets commands will accept an `env` flag; e.g. `keel secrets list --env test`
</Callout>
