# 21 June, 2024

These changes have been released with version `0.387` of the CLI.

## Staging and production configs

Until now, the `keelconfig.yaml` file was applied to your staging and production environments.  This is still true, however you can now override this by creating environment-specific `keelconfig.staging.yaml` and `keelconfig.production.yaml` files.  

We have also introduced a breaking change to the `keelconfig.yaml` schema by removing the environment-type specification in the `environments` section.  You must now rather specify staging and production environment variables in their config files.

See [this page](/keelconfig) for more.
