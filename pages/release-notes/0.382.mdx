# 3rd April, 2024

These changes have been released with version `0.382` of the CLI.

## New built-in type: Markdown

The generated OpenAPI schema for this new field type will be of `type: "string"` and include `format: "markdown"`. This allows clients to automatically handle fields of this type in a specific way, for example, rendering forms with rich-text editors for a more immersive experience.

```
model Post {
    fields {
        title Text
        description Markdown?
    }
}
```

## Previous state in event payloads

Up until now, the full model's payload has been included in the event object's `data` field passed to subscriber functions.  We have added a new field named `previous` which captures the model's data before the mutation occurred that caused the event.  The definition below is an example of what the event payload might look like.

```ts
export interface MemberCreatedEvent = {
  // The unique name of this event, as a string literal
  eventName: "member.created"
  // The timestamp at which the event occured
  occurredAt: DateTime,
  // The identity that triggered the event, if any
  identityId?: string,
  // The targeted model which was mutated
  target: {
     // The id of the mutated model
     id: string,
     // The name of the model type
     type: "Member",
     // The model's data at the time of the event
     data: Member
     // The model's data before the mutation which caused this event
     previous: Member
  }
}
```
