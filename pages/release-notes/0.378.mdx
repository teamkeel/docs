# 02 February, 2024

These changes have been released with version `0.378` of the CLI.

## Improved error tracing

We have recently shipped the [Local Console](/release-notes/0.376) - a really powerful feature that gives you _almost_ full Console support when running the Keel CLI locally. 

We've been enhancing the Monitoring page as we've seen that it's become a very useful tool for local debugging.  

### `console.error()` tracing

Calling `console.error()` from within your function code will now be captured and traced as an error, and the message will become available in the relevant span.

### Error filtering

You can now filter out successful traces on the Monitoring page to only see errors.

## Fixes and Improvements

We've also released [some other fixes and improvements](https://github.com/teamkeel/keel/releases/tag/v0.378.0) to the CLI and Console Tools.

## ⚠️ Upcoming Breaking Changes

Until now, we have supported passing in an OpenID Connect ID Token as a bearer token when making a request to your Keel API. We will be deprecating this change on 16 February. Please migrate to using [ID Token authentication](/authentication/getting-started).

## Next Steps

To upgrade to the latest version, please run the following command:

```bash
brew upgrade keel
```
