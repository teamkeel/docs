These changes have been released with version `0.384` of the CLI.

## Array fields

Keel now supports arrays!  

An array is an ordered list of non-unique values stored in a single field.  For example, a blog post might be tagged under several categories and have reader reviews:

```keel
model BlogPost {
  fields {
    title Text
    categories Category[]
    reviews Number[]
  }

  actions {
    list listBlogPosts(categories, reviews?)
  }
}

enum Category {
  Art
  Science
  Sport
  Technology
  Lifestyle
}
```

Just like any other field type, arrays can be used in `create` and `update` action inputs for writing data, and in `list` action inputs for querying data.

### Querying arrays with actions

All array types have the following query operators available on the `list` action:

| Query operator | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `equals` | Compares an array field against an array literal. Each element must be identical. |
| `notEquals` | Likewise with `equals`, compares against an array literal. The arrays must be different. |
| `any` | Checks that at least one array element satisfies the provided query, which, depending on the underlying type, could be `equals`, `notEquals`, `greaterThan`, `lessThan`, etc. |
| `all` | Checks that all array elements satisfy the provided query. |

For example, the following GraphQL query for `listBlogPosts` will return all blog posts in the `Science` category which have only 4 and 5-star reviews:

```graphql
query {
  listBlogPosts(
    input: {
      where: {
        category: { 
          any: {
            equals: Category.Science
          }
        }
        reviews: {
          all: {
            greaterThanOrEquals: 4
          }
        }
      }
    }
  ) {
    edges {
      node {
        title
        categories
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Using arrays in expressions

Arrays can also be used in expressions.  The following schema demonstrates this with `@where` and `@set`:

```keel
model BlogPost {
  fields {
    title Text
    categories Text[]
  }

  actions {
    create createSciencePost() with (title) {
      @set(blogPost.categories = ["Science"])
    }
    list listSciencePosts() {
      @where("Science" in blogPost.categories)
    }
  }
}
```

### Support in the Console

Arrays are supported throughout the Console. The Internal Tools provide a richer experience to create, update and query array fields:
