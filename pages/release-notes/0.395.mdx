## Files

Today we are shipping [files](/files) support as a first-class feature in Keel. As with any field type, it can be used in models, actions, functions, jobs, subscriber functions and in the generated client.

For example, you can now define a `File` field in your schema, and Keel will handle all the complexities around storing, retrieving and keeping your data secure.

```keel {4}
model Product {
    fields {
        title Text
        image File
    }

    actions {
        get getProduct(id)   
        create createProduct() with (title, image)
    }
}
```

There are a lot of juicy bits to this release, so please head over to the [files](/files) page to read more.

Please make sure to update your CLI by running `npm install -g keel`.

For any issues or feedback, please visit the support channel on our [community Discord](https://keel.so/discord) or contact us at [help@keel.so](mailto:help@keel.so).

Thank you for using Keel!
