## Relative time periods filters

When specifying fields that can be used for filtering the results of a `list` action we can now filter dates and timestamps with relative time periods, such as `today`, `last 7 days`.

For example, given the following schema:

```keel
model Post {
    fields {
        title Text
        body Text
        date Date?
    }

    actions {
        list listPosts(createdAt?, date?)
    }
}
```

Alongside the previously existing where filters for `date` and `createdAt`, this release introduces 3 new filtering options: `beforeRelative`, `afterRelative` and `equalsRelative`. These fields accept a string expression in the following format: 

```
    attribute   value  complete          period
       v          v       v                 v
{this/next/last} {x}? {complete}? {minute/hour/day/week/month/year}
```

For example: `next 3 days`, `last month`, `last 2 complete years`

The components of the expression are: 
* Attribute: `this`/`next`/`last`
* Value: a positive integer. When using the attribute `this`, the `value` must be omitted. When using `next` or `last`, if omitted it will default to `1`.
* Complete: `complete` - specifies if the period we're filtering by will be a completed period: e.g. `last month` will take in account the previous calendar month. If omitted, the period will take in a rolling month (in the case of `last month`).
* Period: `minute`/`hour`/`day`/`week`/`month`/`year` - plural or singular versions are both accepted.

Alongside the expressions following the rule above, there are also a few valid shorthands:

* `now`
* `today` - equivalent to `this day`
* `tomorrow` - equivalent to `next complete day`
* `yesterday` - equivalent to `last complete day`

### `equalsRelative`

Example request payload:
```json
{
    "where":
    {
        "date": {
            "equalsRelative": "this year"
        }
    }
}
```

The results returned will be all items with a `date` after or equal to `2024-01-01` and before `2025-01-01` (assuming the request is made on 22/11/2024).


### `afterRelative`

Example request payload:
```json
{
    "where":
    {
        "date": {
            "afterRelative": "today"
        }
    }
}
```

The results returned will be all items with a `date` after or equal to `2024-11-23` (assuming the request is made on 22/11/2024).

### `beforeRelative`

Example request payload:
```json
{
    "where":
    {
        "date": {
            "beforeRelative": "last 2 complete days"
        }
    }
}
```

The results returned will be all items with a `date` before `2024-11-20` (assuming the request is made on 22/11/2024).

import { Callout } from "@core/callout"

<Callout type="info">
Note that these filter fields can be combined to perform more complex data segmentation; e.g.
```json
{
    // retrieve all items with date >= 2024-01-01 and date < 2024-11-22 
    // (assuming the request is made on 2024-11-22)
    "where":
    {
        "date": {
            "beforeRelative": "today",
            "afterRelative": "last year"
        }
    }
}
```
</Callout>

### ModelAPI & custom functions support

These new filters are also available to be used within hooks, and custom functions, e.g.:

```ts
const hooks: ListPosts = {
    beforeQuery(ctx, inputs, query) {
    return query.where({
      date: {
        beforeRelative: "this week",
      },
    });
  },
};
```

The TS type used for these filters is `RelativeDateString` and should provide expression validation. 

## `Time-Zone` header

The API requests will now accept a `Time-Zone` header. The value must be a [IANA time zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) string. The timezone will be used to accurately calculate the relative date periods when filtering using `beforeRelative`, `afterRelative`, `equalsRelative`.

```sh
curl --location 'https://my-keel-app.keelapps.xyz/api/json/listPosts' \
--header 'Time-Zone: Europe/London' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "where":
    {
        "date": {
            "equalsRelative": "today"
        }
    }
}'
```

## Other improvements & bugfixes

This new release comes with a few smaller improvements and bugfixes:

* Updated go version to 1.23
* Better schema validation for attribute arguments
* `@embed` attribute is now correctly included in code completions
