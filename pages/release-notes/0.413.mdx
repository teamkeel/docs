This release includes the following minor improvements to [computed fields](/models#computed-fields). 

Negation of timestamps
===

A `Timestamp` less a `Timestamp` can be computed into a `Duration`, as shown below.

```keel
model Order {
    fields {
        orderDate Timestamp 
        deliveryDate Timestamp?
        leadTime Duration? @computed(order.deliveryDate - order.orderDate)
    }
}
```

Enum literals
===

We now support the use of enum literals in computed field expressions.

```keel
model Order {
    fields {
        orderStatus OrderStatus
        isComplete Boolean @computed(order.orderStatus == OrderStatus.DELIVERED)
    }
}
```

Searching records by computed fields
===

Computed field values can now also be searched upon with the `list` action, as shown below.

```keel
model Order {
    actions {
        list listOrders(orderStatus, leadTime)
    }
}
```
