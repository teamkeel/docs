# 15 November, 2023

These changes have been released with version `0.372` of the CLI.

## Improvements to Function Hooks
â€‹
Weâ€™ve made some improvements and bug fixes to the way function hooks work and also updated the [docs](/functions) page, but here is a summary of the changes:
â€‹
* All hooks are now typed so they can be async / return Promises
* `beforeQuery` in an `update` function can now return a query builder
* `beforeWrite` in an `update` function now receives the _current_ record as a fourth argument
* `beforeWrite` is now called for `delete` functions
* Both `beforeWrite` and `afterWrite` for `delete` functions are passed the record that is being deleted as the third argument, rather than just the id

### Using non-model inputs

Another thing that is now fully supported is using non-model inputs in functions. An example of this would be something like:
â€‹
```keel
model Film {
  fields {
    title Text
    releaseDate Date?
  }
  actions {
    list searchFilms(title, unreleased: Boolean?) @function
  }
}
```
â€‹
In this schema the `searchThings` action accepts `title` which is a model field and `unreleased` which is **not a model field** and is explicitly typed as an optional boolean. The default query that is generated for this function will handle the `title` input automatically but will do nothing with the `unreleased` input - that is for you to handle in your function. For example:
â€‹
```ts
export default SearchThings({
  beforeQuery(ctx, inputs, query) {
    if (inputs.unreleased) {
      return query.where({
        releaseDate: {
          equals: null,
        },
      })
    }
â€‹
    return query;
  }
});
```
â€‹
Non-model inputs can use any basic type - `Text`, `Boolean`, `Number`, `Date`, and `Timestamp` as well as enums.

## 3rd-party Authentication

We have been working on providing _really good_ support for integrating your Keel app with third-party authentication providers, such as Google, Facebook and the likes.  Not only that, but we are working on providing a better (and more secure) auth experience using access tokens, refresh tokens, and a set of dedicated OAuth2 endpoints.  Do watch this space over the next 2 weeks! ðŸ‘€

### OIDC Token Authentication (pre-release)

Today we have shipped a pre-release of **OIDC Token authentication**.  With this flow, you can authenticate your users from any OpenID Connect provider using just an ID token. This feature is not yet publicly available, nor have we published documentation for it, but if you would like to get started early then please do raise your hand on our Discord channel.  We'll happily work with you on getting integrated.

## Fixes and Improvements

We've also released [a bunch of fixes and improvements](https://github.com/teamkeel/keel/releases/tag/v0.372.0) to our CLI, the SDK packages, and to our VS Code extension. 

For any issues or feedback, please visit the support channel on our [community discord](https://keel.so/discord) or contact us at [help@keel.so](mailto:help@keel.so)**.**

Thank you for using Keel!
