## Duration field type

This release introduces a new first-class Keel field type: `Duration`. This will capture an interval of time. For example:

```keel
model Employee {
    fields {
        name Text
        startDate Date
        periodOfService Duration
    }
}
```

Fields of this type will be persisted in the database as an `interval` value. API responses and requests will expect fields to be provided as [ISO8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Durations) formatted strings. 

### ModelAPI & Functions runtime

In the ModelAPI and the custom functions runtime, we are introducing a new `Duration` class. Similar to `File` and `InlineFile`, model fields of type duration will be instances of this `Duration` class. Please refer to the [Model API](/functions/sdk/modelApi#duration) documentation for full usage and more information on how to interact with these rich data types.
