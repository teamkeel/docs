## `@computed` support for `Text` fields

We now support computing values for `Text` fields.  In addition, you can build a custom string with concatenation and literals.  See example below.

```keel
model Order {
  fields {
    title Text @computed(order.customer.name + " order")
    customer Customer
  }
}

model Customer {
  fields {
    name Text
  }
}
```

## `@computed` for relationships

There may be cases where you want to ensure a relationship is always same at multiple places in your data model. This can now be achieved by using the `@computed` attribute on the to-many side of a relationship, as shown in the example below.

```keel
model ProcessOrder {
  fields {
    customer Customer @computed(orderJob.order.customer)
    order Order 
  }
}

model Order {
  fields {
    customer Customer
  }
}

model Customer {
  fields {
    name Text
    orders Order[]
  }
}
```
