These changes have been released with version `0.380` of the CLI.

## Revamped authorization on the generated client

We've made some significant upgrades to the generated TypeScript client to support our new [authentication flows](authentication/getting-started) and to take away the complexity of you having to deal with the token endpoint and refreshing tokens.  We have built in support for:

 - 💡 Tokens all handled implicitly and no need to call `auth/token/`
 - 🗝 Password authentication
 - 🗝 ID Token authentication
 - 🗝 Single Sign-On authentication
 - ♻️ Automatic refreshing of access tokens
 - ♻️ Support for Refresh Token Rotation
 - 🚪 Signing out on the server
 - 👋 Migrated away from using the deprecated `authenticate` action

Have a look at the [new Generated Client documention](apis/client) on how to go about using the revamped client!

  The API has changed a bit, which means that you will need to perform a minor migration. Please see the next section.
</Callout>

### Migration steps

#### Calling `auth/token/` manually

There is no need to call on our token endpoint anymore.  This happens implicitly when calling any of the new authenticate methods.

```ts
// Signing in with an email and password
await client.auth.authenticateWithPassword(email, password);
```

```ts
// Signing in with a ID token
await client.auth.authenticateWithIdToken(idToken);
```

```ts
// Signing in with a Single Sign-On auth code
await client.auth.authenticateWithSingleSignOn(idToken);
```

#### Setting tokens manually

There is no need to set tokens anymore because the client will now handle all of this for you.  Previously it was necessary to call `client.setToken(accessToken)`.  This has been removed from the API.

We have also removed `client.ctx.token` from the API.  If you do, for whatever reason, need to retrieve the tokens, then make a call to the token stores: `client.auth.accessToken.get()` and `client.auth.refreshToken.get()`.

#### Checking for an active session

Please use the `ctx.auth.isAuthenticated()` async function to check if a session is still active.  This new method is a lot more powerful because if an access token has expired then it will be automatically refreshed at the server for you.  `client.ctx.isAuthenticated` has been removed from the API.

```ts
// Check if the session is still active and refresh it if necessary
if(await ctx.auth.isAuthenticated()) {
    // Success!
} else {
    // Authenticate again
}
```

#### Logging out

Previously calling the method `client.auth.clearToken()` would remove the token from the client.  However, this wouldn't actually sign the session out and revoke the refresh token for future use.  This has been removed from the API in favour of the following.

```ts
// Sign out the session both in the client and from the authentication server
await client.auth.logout();
```

#### Deprecated `authenticate()` action

As we have previously announced, we have replaced the  built-in  `authenticate()` with our new authentication flows.  If you have been using the `authenticate()` action on the client, then please migrate to using the following:

```ts
// Authenticate with the password flow
await client.auth.authenticateWithPassword(email, password);

if(await ctx.auth.isAuthenticated()) {
    // Success!
}
```

## Fixes and Improvements

We've also released [some other fixes and improvements](https://github.com/teamkeel/keel/releases/tag/v0.380.0) to the CLI, Console Tools, and VS Code extension.
