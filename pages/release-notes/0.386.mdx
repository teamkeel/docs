# 07 May, 2024

These changes have been released with version `0.386` of the CLI.

## The `Decimal` type

Keel now supports decimal numbers!  This is useful for cases in which you need to store fractional values.  For example, the currency value of some store item could be defined as `Decimal`.

```keel
model Product {
  fields {
    name Text
    salePrice Decimal
    stockCount Number
  }
}
```

## Capturing user info from 3rd party providers

When using ID Token or Single Sign-On authentication, we now capture user info data from the 3rd party provider (if they are available) and store them in `Identity`. This data will also be updated every time the user authenticates. These new fields on `Identity` are `name`, `familyName`, `givenName`, `middleName`, `nickName`, `profile`, `picture`, `website`, `gender`, `zoneInfo` and `locale`.

This provides a lot more context for who the `Identity` represents which means you now don't necessarily need to request this from the user. We recommend the following pattern:

```keel
model User {
  fields {
    name Text
    email Text
    identity Identity @unique
  }
  
  actions {
    create newUser() with (username) {
      // Associate this new user with the currently authenticated Identity
      @set(user.identity = ctx.identity)

      // Capture the name and email from the Identity
      @set(user.name = ctx.identity.name)
      @set(user.email = ctx.identity.email)

      // The user must be authenticated to perform this action
      @permission(expression: ctx.isAuthenticated)
    }
  }
}
```

## Local PostgreSQL upgrade

The CLI has been upgraded to use v16 of PostgreSQL. This does mean that your local data will not be immediately available to your apps running on the updated CLI.

However, the data is not deleted.  If you downgrade your version of Keel, the data will be made available again to your app.  If you would like to migrate this data, then this will need to be done manually by moving the data from the `keel-pg-volume` Docker volume to the `keel-pg-volume-16` volume. Let us know if you need help with this. 

## Fixes and Improvements

We've also released [some other fixes and improvements](https://github.com/teamkeel/keel/releases/tag/v0.386.0) to the CLI and runtime.
