<Callout type="warning">
This release contains a number of minor breaking changes to expressions. Please see the [this section](#changes-to-expressions) below for steps to migrate.
</Callout>

## Computed fields

Today we've released a powerful new feature to the Keel runtime - [computed fields](/models#computed-fields). 

This allows you to have a field automatically set or calculated based on an expression. Computed fields can even reference fields in related models. For one-to-many lookups, we've introduced functions which let you aggregate related data. At present, we support `SUM`, `MIN`, `MAX`, `AVG`, `MEDIAN`, and `COUNT` aggregate functions.

See the example below.

```keel
model Order {
  fields {
    // Performing an aggregated calculation in a one-to-many lookup
    total Decimal @computed(SUM(order.items.subTotal))
    // Performing an simple calculation using the total fields on this model
    vat Decimal @computed(order.total * 0.2)
    // This demonstrates how computed fields can reference other computed fields
    totalExcludingVat Decimal @computed(order.total - order.vat)
    items OrderItem[]
  }
}

model OrderItem {
  fields {
    order Order
    product Product
    quantity Number
    // Performing a calculation on related data in a many-to-one lookup
    subTotal Decimal @computed(orderItem.product.price * orderItem.quantity)
  }
}

model Product {
  fields {
    name Text
    price Decimal
  }
}
```

## Changes to expressions

We've also made a few minor breaking changes to the expression syntax. We kindly ask that you consult the two changes listed below and make the necessary updates to your schema.

### `&&` and `||` operators

We'e replaced the `and` and `or` operators with `&&` and `||` respectively. The behaviour is the exact same except now the syntax is now more consistent with other languages.

### `not in` deprecated

The `not in` operator has been deprecated. In order to achieve the same result, we suggest that you use the negation, `!` operator.  For example, `!(ctx.identity in team.members.identity)`
