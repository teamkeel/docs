These changes have been released with version `0.388` of the CLI.

## VS Code extension performance improvement

The Keel extension provides a rich experience when working on your schema in VS Code.  We've now released some significant performance improvements which make for a much snappier response from the extension. 

The extension will also now use your locally installed Keel CLI to report on any validation errors in the your schema.  This is great because it means that validations reported by the extension and by your installed CLI will be consistent.

Please make sure to update your CLI by running `npm install -g keel`.

For any issues or feedback, please visit the support channel on our [community Discord](https://keel.so/discord) or contact us at [help@keel.so](mailto:help@keel.so).

Thank you for using Keel!
