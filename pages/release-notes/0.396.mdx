## Validate your config file with the CLI

Running the `keel validate` CLI command will now, in addition to checking your Keel schema, also validate your `keelconfig.yaml` configuration file, as demonstrated in the example below.

## Enabling and disabling transactions in functions

Mutation [function hooks](/functions/action-hooks) (on `create` or `update` actions) and the [`write` custom function](/functions/custom-functions) are, by default, wrapped in transactions. This means that if an error occurs in your code the transaction will get rolled back and no mutations will persist to your database. All [other functions](/functions#transaction-support) have transactions disabled by default.

This is a great default but there are times where you might want to explicitly enable or disable transactions for your functions. We now support this by exposing a function config from which you can set `autoTransaction` accordingly. 

For example, below we demonstrate enabling transactions for a job.

```ts
MyJob.config = {
  autoTransaction: true,
};

export default MyJob(async (ctx, inputs) => {
  // ...
});
```

Simirlarly, we can disable transactions for some write hook.

```ts
const hooks: MyFunctionHooks = {
  beforeWrite: async (ctx, inputs, values, record) => {
   // ...
  },
};

MyFunction.config = {
  autoTransaction: false,
};

export default MyFunction(hooks);
```

import { Callout } from "@core/callout"

<Callout type="warning">
While they are disabled for now, please note that we do intend to enable transactions by default on event subscribers in the future.
</Callout>

Please make sure to update your CLI by running `npm install -g keel`.
