## Validate your config file with the CLI

Running the `keel validate` CLI command will now, in addition to checking your Keel schema, also validate your `keelconfig.yaml` configuration file, as demonstrated in the example below.

## Disabling transactions in mutation functions

Mutation [function hooks](/functions/action-hooks) (on `create` or `update` actions) and the [`write` custom function](/functions/custom-functions) are, by default, wrapped in transactions. This means that if an error occurs in your code the transaction will get rolled back and no mutations will persist to your database.

However, there are times where you do want to write to the database *and* also return an error. If you wish to disable using transactions, you can now set the function config as shown below.

```ts
MyFunction.config = {
  autoTransaction: false,
};

export default MyFunction(async (ctx, inputs) => {
  // ...
});
```

Simirlarly for function hooks, it will look as follows.

```ts
const hooks: MyFunctionHooks = {
  beforeWrite: async (ctx, inputs, values, record) => {
   // ...
  },
};

MyFunction.config = {
  autoTransaction: false,
};

export default MyFunction(hooks);
```

import { Callout } from "@core/callout"

<Callout type="warning">
While they are disabled for now, please note that we do intend to enable transactions by default on event subscribers in the future.
</Callout>

Please make sure to update your CLI by running `npm install -g keel`.
