## Validate your config file with the CLI

Running the `keel validate` CLI command will now, in addition to checking your Keel schema, also validate your `keelconfig.yaml` configuration file, as demonstrated in the example below.

## Enabling and disabling transactions in functions

Mutation [function hooks](/functions/action-hooks) (on `create` or `update` actions) and the [`write` custom function](/functions/custom-functions) are, by default, wrapped in transactions. This means that if an error occurs in your code the transaction will get rolled back and no mutations will persist to your database. All [other functions](/functions#transaction-support) have transactions disabled by default.

This is a great default but there are times where you might want to explicitly enable or disable transactions for your functions. We now support this by exposing function configs.

For example, below we demonstrate enabling transactions for a job.

```ts
MyJob.config = {
  autoTransaction: true,
};

export default MyJob(async (ctx, inputs) => {
  // ...
});
```

Simirlarly, we can disable transactions for some write hook.

```ts
const hooks: MyFunctionHooks = {
  beforeWrite: async (ctx, inputs, values, record) => {
   // ...
  },
};

MyFunction.config = {
  autoTransaction: false,
};

export default MyFunction(hooks);
```

import { Callout } from "@core/callout"

<Callout type="warning">
While they are disabled for now, please note that we do intend to enable transactions by default on event subscribers in the future.
</Callout>

Please make sure to update your CLI by running `npm install -g keel`.
