We have released some excited changes to Keel.  These changes have been released with version `0.389` of the CLI.

## Embedded models in response data

The [`@embed` attribute](/actions/#the-embed-attribute) allows you to include related model data as part of the response for `list` and `get` actions on the JSON API. This can be a really useful way to fetch all the data you need and avoid having to perform multiple requests.

For example, when fetching `Order` it definitely makes sense to also include all the details about that order (products, number of units, and prices). We can now achieve this with `@embed` as shown below.

```keel {8,9}
model Order {
    fields {
        items OrderItem[]
    }

    actions {
        get getOrder(id) {
            @embed(items)
            @embed(items.product)
        }
    }
}

model OrderItem {
    fields {
        order Order
        product Product
        units Number
        price Decimal
    }
}

model Product {
    fields {
        name Text
    }
}
```

The response from `getOrder` on the JSON API will now include all the embedded data:

```json
{
    "id": "2juubv0JbHrzv8rCG9QB56qTGJs",
    "items": [
        {
           
            "id": "2juubv3ejcXn0senuEepizX0Oyi",
            "orderId": "2juubv0JbHrzv8rCG9QB56qTGJs",

            },
            "units": 1,
            "price": 149.99,
            "createdAt": "2024-07-29T10:35:56.528001Z",

        },
        {

            "orderId": "2juubv0JbHrzv8rCG9QB56qTGJs",
            "product": {

                "createdAt": "2024-07-29T10:34:44.758902Z",
            },
            "units": 3,
            "price": 329.99,
            "createdAt": "2024-07-29T10:35:56.528001Z",
            "updatedAt": "2024-07-29T10:35:56.528001Z"
        }
    ],
    "createdAt": "2024-07-29T10:35:56.528001Z",
    "updatedAt": "2024-07-29T10:35:56.528001Z"
}
```



With the `@embed` attribute, 

The Keel extension provides a rich experience when working on your schema in VS Code.  We've now released some significant performance improvements which make for a much snappier response from the extension. 

The extension will also now use your locally installed Keel CLI to report on any validation errors in the your schema.  This is great because it means that validations reported by the extension and by your installed CLI will be consistent.

Please make sure to update your CLI by running `npm install -g keel`.

For any issues or feedback, please visit the support channel on our [community Discord](https://keel.so/discord) or contact us at [help@keel.so](mailto:help@keel.so).

Thank you for using Keel!
