We have released some excited changes to Keel.  These changes have been released with version `0.389` of the CLI.

## Embedded models in response data

The [`@embed` attribute](/actions/#the-embed-attribute) allows you to include related model data as part of the response for `list` and `get` actions on the JSON API. This can be a really useful way to fetch all the data you need and avoid having to perform multiple requests.

For example, when fetching `Order` it definitely makes sense to also include all the details about that order (products, number of units, and prices). We can now achieve this with `@embed` as shown below.

```keel {8,9}
model Order {
    fields {
        items OrderItem[]
    }

    actions {
        get getOrder(id) {
            @embed(items)
            @embed(items.product)
        }
    }
}

model OrderItem {
    fields {
        order Order
        product Product
        units Number
        price Decimal
    }
}

model Product {
    fields {
        name Text
    }
}
```

The response from `getOrder` on the JSON API will now include all the embedded data:

```json
{
    "id": "2juubv0JbHrzv8rCG9QB56qTGJs",
    "items": [
        {
           
            "id": "2juubv3ejcXn0senuEepizX0Oyi",
            "orderId": "2juubv0JbHrzv8rCG9QB56qTGJs",
            "product": {
                "id": "2juuTMDvA5jHEHDcsQ6LrGJAq48",
                "name": "Cot",
                "createdAt": "2024-07-29T10:34:49.399894Z",
                "updatedAt": "2024-07-29T10:34:49.399894Z"
            },
            "units": 1,
            "price": 149.99,
            "createdAt": "2024-07-29T10:35:56.528001Z",
            "updatedAt": "2024-07-29T10:35:56.528001Z"
        },
        {
            "id": "2juubv4kfrMMVj9d3ohZmoRXs3I",
            "orderId": "2juubv0JbHrzv8rCG9QB56qTGJs",
            "product": {
                "id": "2juuStluQKb01Qm3chgWjpw7sIb",
                "name": "Bed",
                "updatedAt": "2024-07-29T10:34:44.758902Z",
                "createdAt": "2024-07-29T10:34:44.758902Z",
            },
            "units": 3,
            "price": 329.99,
            "createdAt": "2024-07-29T10:35:56.528001Z",
            "updatedAt": "2024-07-29T10:35:56.528001Z"
        }
    ],
    "createdAt": "2024-07-29T10:35:56.528001Z",
    "updatedAt": "2024-07-29T10:35:56.528001Z"
}
```

## Auth hooks

[Auth hooks](/functions/auth-hooks) are a new kind of function that we have just introduced. They allow you to insert custom logic into the authentication flow.

Current we support two type of auth hooks:
 - `afterIdentityCreated`: executes when a new `Identity` model is created during authentication, and
 - `afterAuthentication`: executes after authentication completes, whether successful or not.

Let's demonstrate this with the `Account` schema below. Let's say we want to automatically create a new `Account` model and associate it to the `Identity` created when the user signs in for the first time.

```keel
model Account {
    fields {
        name Text
        identity Identity @unique
    }
}
```

This will require implementing `afterIdentityCreated`.  First we enable this in the `keelconfig.yaml`:

```yaml
auth:
  hooks:
    - afterIdentityCreated
```

Then we run `keel generate` to scaffold out the function us. 

And then we complete the function as shown below. 

```typescript
import { AfterIdentityCreated, models } from '@teamkeel/sdk';

// This synchronous hook will execute after successful authentication and a new identity record created
export default AfterIdentityCreated(async (ctx) => {
    const identity = ctx.identity!;
    await models.account.create({ name: identity.name ?? "", identityId: identity.id });
});
```

This will now execute whenever an `Identity` is created!


Please make sure to update your CLI by running `npm install -g keel`.
