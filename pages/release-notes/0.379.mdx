# 12 February, 2024

These changes have been released with version `0.379` of the CLI.

## Keel on NPM 

We have moved the [Keel CLI to NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/keel)!

This does mean that we will no longer be updating the Homebrew tap with new versions of the CLI.

Let's get set up.

### Remove Homebrew

First, let's remove the Homebrew installation of Keel.

```bash
$ brew uninstall keel
$ brew untap teamkeel/homebrew-keel
```

### Install Keel from NPM

Next, let's install Keel from NPM.

```bash
$ npm install -g keel
```

Let's see if it all worked.  If you run the following command, you should see the ouput of `v0.379.1`

```bash
$ keel -v
v0.379.1
```

## Keel on Windows

Keel is now supported on Windows. And with our move to NPM, installation is a piece of cake.

## Fixes and Improvements

We've also released [some other fixes and improvements](https://github.com/teamkeel/keel/releases/tag/v0.379.1) to the CLI, Console Tools, and VS Code extension.

## ⚠️ Upcoming Breaking Changes

The built-in action `authenticate()` will be deprecated by the next release (earliest 19th February). Please migrate to using [the Password authentication flow](/authentication/flows/password).
