# 26 October, 2023

These changes have been released with version `0.370` of the CLI.

## Watch mode for client generation

Run `keel client --watch` to generate your [Keel Client](https://docs.keel.so/keel-auth-with-nextjs/building-the-backend#generating-the-keel-client) in real time!

We have added a watch mode to the `keel client` generation command using the `--watch` flag which will continuously detect changes to your Keel schema files and subsequently regenerate your client code.

## Looking up models with composite keys

[Composite unique fields](https://docs.keel.so/models#composite-unique-fields) can now be used to lookup a model with the `get`, `update` and `delete` Action types. 

This provides a lot of convenience when you already have *real-world*, unique identifiers for your models and don't necessarily always need or want to look them up by `id`. Take the following example below where we update a `Product` by looking up its composite unique fields.

```keel
model Product {
    fields {
        name Text
        supplierCode Text
        supplierSku Text
    }

    @unique([supplierSku, supplierCode])

    actions {
        update updateProduct(supplierSku, supplierCode) with (name)
    }
}
```

## Looking up models using relationships

We have further extended the `get`, `update`, and `delete` Action types to support an even smarter way to look up models using relationships.  We amend the previous example to demonstrate this.

```keel
model Supplier {
    fields {
        code @unique
    }
}

model Product {
    fields {
        name Text
        supplierSku Text
    }

    @unique([supplierSku, supplier])

    actions {
        update updateProduct(supplierSku, supplier.code) with (name)
    }
}
```

## Fixes and Improvements

 - `keel init` will now generate files in non-empty directories, but won't overwrite any existing files.
 - A faster experience when running `keel geneate` as we now pull NPM dependencies when we really need to.
 - `keel generate` will politely amend, rather than overwrite, the `tsconfig.json` file if it exists.
 - General improvements to how we pipe output to the terminal when running `keel test` and `keel generate`.


## Next Steps

To upgrade to the latest version, please run the following command:

```bash
brew upgrade keel
```
