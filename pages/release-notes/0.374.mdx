# 18 December, 2023

These changes have been released with version `0.374` of the CLI.

## Starting a new project with `keel init`

The `keel init` command guides you through setting up a new project from scratch. It also supports templates, which means you can get started with a working Keel schema and functions. 

![keel init](/release-notes/0-374-keel-init.gif)

These starter templates can be found at [https://github.com/teamkeel/starter-templates](https://github.com/teamkeel/starter-templates). We only support one template for the moment.

## Support for creating nested records with functions

Up to now we have supported [creating nested records](/actions#creating-nested-records) for built-in actions. We have now extended support of this feature to functions!

Take this schema, for example.

```keel
model Author {
  fields {
    name Text
    books Book[]
  }

  actions {
    create createAuthor(name, books.title) @function
  }
}

model Book {
  fields {
    author Author
    title Text
  }
}
```

The following API request will now create both the author and the linked book record.

```jsonc
// POST /api/json/createAuthor
{
  "name": "Emily Bronte",
  "books": [
    {
      "title": "Wuthering Heights"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Fixes and Improvements

We've also released [a bunch of fixes and improvements](https://github.com/teamkeel/keel/releases/tag/v0.374.0) to our CLI and to our VS Code extension. 

For any issues or feedback, please visit the support channel on our [community discord](https://keel.so/discord) or contact us at [help@keel.so](mailto:help@keel.so)**.**

Thank you for using Keel!
