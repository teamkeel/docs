These changes have been shipped with version `0.402` of the CLI.

<Callout type="warning">
This release contains a number of minor breaking changes to our functions SDKs.
</Callout>

## Kysely update

In Keel functions it is possible to interact directly with the database by [importing `useDatabase`](functions/sdk/databaseApi). This exposes an instance of [Kysely](https://kysely.dev/), a powerful SQL builder for TypeScript.

This update sees a big update to the Kysely package, which includes their latest query builder API.  However, this has introduced some breaking changes.  Please visit their [examples](https://kysely.dev/docs/category/examples) or [API docs](https://kysely-org.github.io/kysely-apidoc/) for more on what you might need to change in your function code.

## Model API's `orWhere` deprecated

The `orWhere` function has been removed from our functions runtime API.  This change is aligned with how we intend the Model API to mature over time. If you have been using `orWhere` in your functions, you may need to consider using Kysely's API while we work on a better way to multiple conditions in the Model API.
