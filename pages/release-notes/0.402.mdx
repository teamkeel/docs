<Callout type="warning">
This release contains a number of minor breaking changes to our functions SDKs.
</Callout>

## Kysely update

In Keel functions it is possible to interact directly with the database by [importing `useDatabase`](/functions/sdk/databaseApi). This exposes an instance of [Kysely](https://kysely.dev/), a powerful SQL builder for TypeScript.

This update sees a big update to the Kysely package, which includes their latest query builder API.  However, this has introduced some breaking changes.  Please visit their [examples](https://kysely.dev/docs/category/examples) or [API docs](https://kysely-org.github.io/kysely-apidoc/) for more on what you might need to change in your function code.

## Model API's `orWhere` deprecated

The `orWhere` function has been removed from our functions runtime API.  This change is aligned with how we intend the Model API to mature over time. If you have been using `orWhere` in your functions, you may need to consider using Kysely's API while we work on an improved way to support multiple conditions in a Model API query.

Below is an example of how you might achieve this using Kysely's API.

```ts
const persons = await db
  .selectFrom('person')
  .selectAll()
  // 1. Using the `or` method on the expression builder:
  .where((eb) => eb.or([
    eb('firstName', '=', 'Jennifer'),
    eb('firstName', '=', 'Sylvester')
  ]))
  // 2. Chaining expressions using the `or` method on the created expressions:
  .where((eb) =>
    eb('lastName', '=', 'Aniston').or('lastName', '=', 'Stallone')
  )
  .execute()
```
