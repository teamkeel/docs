# 17 January, 2024

These changes have been released with version `0.376` of the CLI.

## Local Console support

We have shipped live [Console](https://console.keel.so/) support for local CLI development! 🚀 

This means that all the rich tooling previously only available to your hosted environments can now be used when running your Keel project locally (i.e. when using `keel run`).  This includes the operate tools, database viewer, API explorer, schema visualiser, and monitoring.

And it's _really_ easy.  Run your local Keel project with `keel run`, go to [https://console.keel.so/](https://console.keel.so/), choose the **Local project** option in your projects list, and ***TA-DA*** - all the Console tooling at your fingertips!

We've also released [a bunch of fixes and improvements](https://github.com/teamkeel/keel/releases/tag/v0.376.0) to our CLI and to our VS Code extension. 

## Next Steps

To upgrade to the latest version, please run the following command:

```bash

```
