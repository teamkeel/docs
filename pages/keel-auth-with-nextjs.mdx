## Set up Keel Auth with Next.js

Security is always a top priority for any application but it can be tricky to do this the right way. Keel simplifies this with its built-in authorization system and flexible authentication options, ensuring your apps are secure and user data is protected effectively.

In this guide, we will go through the following:

- Build a simple Keel backend schema.
- Set up Keel Client package
- Connect our Keel backend to a NextJS frontend application with full authentication ability.

The powerful thing about Keel is authentication is catered for by default in every backend built with Keel. You do not need to create a custom authorization system when you use Keel, all you need is to call a single endpoint and you’re on your way.

Let’s test this out!
