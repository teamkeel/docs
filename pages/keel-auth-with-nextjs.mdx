## Set up Keel Auth with Next.js

Security is always a top priority for any application but it can be tricky to do this the right way. Keel simplifies this with its built-in authorization system and flexible authentication options, ensuring your apps are secure and user data is protected effectively.

In this guide, we will go through the following:

- Build a simple Keel backend schema.
- Set up Keel Client package
- Connect our Keel backend to a Next.js frontend application with full authentication ability.

The powerful thing about Keel is authentication is catered for by default in every backend built with Keel. You do not need to create a custom authorization system when you use Keel, all you need is to call a single endpoint and youâ€™re on your way.

Letâ€™s test this out!
