# Jobs

Jobs in Keel allow you to execute tasks in the background away from your normal workflow.
This can be very useful if you have tasks that need to be run on a regular basis, or that take longer
to run than usual. 

Jobs can be scheduled and run on a repeating, scheduled basis.

You can define a job in the schema, and implement it just like a [function](./functions). Job definitions are root level blocks, along with Models, Roles and APIs.

```keel filename="schema.keel"
job EmailNewCustomerReport {
    @schedule("0 6 * * 5")
}
```

This example defines a job called `EmailNewCustomerReport` that is scheduled to run every Friday.

Running `keel generate` in the CLI will create a new jobs file in a directory called `./jobs`. The file created for us will look something like this.

```tsx filename="jobs/emailNewCustomerReport.ts"
import { EmailNewCustomerReport } from "@teamkeel/sdk";

export default EmailNewCustomerReport(async (ctx) => {
  // your code here
});
```

To implement this job, we can use the same generated [APIs](./functions/sdk) that are available to functions.

## Scheduled jobs

A scheduled job is a job that has a `@schedule` attribute inside it. This attribute uses [cron](https://devhints.io/cron) format to define the
schedule by which then job is executed. Scheduled jobs take no inputs.

```keel filename="schema.keel"
job EmailNewCustomerReport {
  @schedule("0 6 * * 5")
}
```

The example above executes the `EmailNewCustomerReport` job at 6:00 every Friday.

Jobs may need to be executed on more than one schedule. Because of this, it is possible to define more than one `@schedule` attribute for a job.

```keel filename="schema.keel"
job EmailNewCustomerReport {
  @schedule("0 0 7 ? * 1,2,3,4 *")
  @schedule("0 6 * * 5")
}
```

The example above executes the `EmailNewCustomerReport` job at 7:00 every Monday to Thursday but on Fridays it will execute it at 6:00.

## Manual Jobs

> Manual jobs are coming soon. These are jobs that can take inputs and are run from the Keel console.

## Testing

To help you develop your jobs, Keel makes them available within [tests](./testing).

```tsx filename="jobs/email-new-customer-report.test.ts"

import { jobs, actions, models, resetDatabase } from "@teamkeel/testing";
import { test, expect, beforeEach } from "vitest";

beforeEach(resetDatabase);

test("Test EmailNewCustomerReport updates new customer flag", async () => {
    console.log("Test start")

    await jobs.emailNewCustomerReport();

    const res = await actions.getCustomer();
    expect(res.reportSent).toBeTruthy();
  });
```
