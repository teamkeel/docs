# `keelconfig.yaml`

The `keelconfig.yaml` file is expected at the root of your project and is used to configure your Keel backend. It enables configuring the following options:

- Environment variables
- Secrets 
- Authentication

Let's walk through how you can configure each of these options.

## Environment variables

Environment variables are values that are passed to your application at runtime, dependent on the environment in which it is running. For example, you may have a `EXTERNAL_API_URL` environment variable that points to some external API in your development environment, but points to a different API in your production environment and yet another API in your staging environment.

This can be configured like so in your `keelconfig.yaml` file:

```yaml
environment:
  staging:
    - name: EXTERNAL_API_URL
      value: "https://staging.some-api.com"
  production:
    - name: DB_URL
      value: "https://some-api.com"
```

We cover this in more detail under the [Environment Variables](/envvars) section of the docs.

## Secrets

Secrets are similar to environment variables, but are used to store sensitive information such as API keys, passwords, etc. In your `keelconfig.yaml`, you can store names of secrets that your application will depend on, while their values are stored in your Keel backend.

Secrets can be configured like so in your `keelconfig.yaml` file:

```yaml filename="keelconfig.yaml"
secrets:
  - name: MY_SECRET
  - name: MY_OTHER_SECRET
```

To set a secret locally, you can use the `keel secret set` command from the Keel [CLI](/cli), and to set a secret in your deployed backend on Keel, you can use the **Secrets** page in the console.

We cover secrets in more detail in its dedicated [page](/secrets).

## Authentication

Authentication enables users to sign up and log in to your application using a number of open paradigms, such as SSO (Single Sign-on), OpenID Connect, and more. Keel supports a number of authentication providers out of the box, and you can configure them in your `keelconfig.yaml` file like so:

```yaml filename="keelconfig.yaml"
auth:
  redirectUrl: http://localhost:8000/callback
  providers:
    - type: google
      name: google
      clientId: 1234
```

We cover authentication in more detail in its dedicated [page](/authentication/getting-started).
