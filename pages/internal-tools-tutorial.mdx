# Internal Tools Tutorial

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ’¡">
  If this is your first time deploying with Keel you might want to follow the [basic tutorial](/tutorial) before continuing.
</Callout>

In this tutorial we will create a simple interface to manage stock inventory. We will create 3 basic [models](/models) in a Keel [schema](/quickstart#the-keel-schema). Specifically, we'll create `Product`, `StockItem` and `StockLocation` models. These will let a user:

1. list products
2. create a stock location & create a product with stock items
3. view a product
4. find stock items
5. remove a stock item
6. list out-of-stock products
7. create a stock item

You will learn how to create [internal tools](/internal-tools) from [actions](/actions) and access them in the [Keel Console](https://console.keel.so).
