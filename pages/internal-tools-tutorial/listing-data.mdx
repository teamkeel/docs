# Listing data

Let's create a tool called `List products` by adding a simple `list` action to the `Product` model. This will display a data table with a list of all Products in the database.

As we recall, this is our full schema from the previous section:

```keel
model Product {
    fields {
        name Text
        description Text?
        imageUrl Text?
        stock StockItem[]
    }
}

model StockItem {
    fields {
        product Product
        quantity Number
        location StockLocation
    }
}

model StockLocation {
    fields {
        name Text @unique
        items StockItem[]
    }
}
```

## Creating a list action

Let's augment it with a `list` action on the `Product` model:

```keel {9-11}
model Product {
    fields {
        name Text
        description Text?
        imageUrl Text?
        stock StockItem[]
    }

    actions {
        list listProducts()
    }
}

// Other models omitted for brevity
```

Now, if we `git push` this and deploy it to Keel, we can see the new action in the Console:

![First action](/internal-tools-tutorial-first-action.png)

However, when we try to run this action, we get an error:

![No permission set](/internal-tools-tutorial-no-permission.png)

This is because Keel is secure by default and requires you to explicitly set permissions for each action. Let's do that now.

## Setting permissions

In order for a Console user to be able to run any action they need [permissions](/permissions). If you want to just allow anyone with access to your Keel project to run an action you can use the expression `ctx.isAuthenticated`. If you want only certain members of your team to be able to use an action you can use [roles](/permissions#roles).

```keel {13-16}
model Product {
    fields {
        name Text
        description Text?
        imageUrl Text?
        stock StockItem[]
    }

    actions {
        list listProducts()
    }

    @permission(
        expression: ctx.isAuthenticated,
        actions: [list]
    )
}

// Other models omitted for brevity
```

Now we can run the list action and see the results. Since we haven't created any entries yet, the list is empty.

Let's explore how we can create products and insert them into our database using generated internal tools in the next section.
