# Using the internal tools

A common use case for an inventory management system is to list products that have no stock. To do this, we can add `stock.id` as an input to the `listProducts` action. It generates a panel that let's you set input values.

```keel {8}
model Product {
    fields {
        ...
        stock StockItem[]
    }
    actions {
        ...
        list listProducts(stock.id?)
    }
}
```

In the generated tool, setting this input value to `null` will let you find products where no stock exists.

Let's keep the original list action as it was and create a second list action. When many actions of the same type exist in a model, the tool generates a panel that let's you quickly switch between them.
```keel {8-9}
model Product {
    fields {
        ...
        stock StockItem[]
    }
    actions {
        ...
        list listProducts()
        list listProductsWhereStock(stock.id)
    }
}
```

We can switch between list views using the generated user interface using the new dropdown element:

## Putting it all together

Now, we've got a complete end-to-end stock management solution with zero application code written: we had to write no frontend logic or backend logic, but instead declaratively described our application with a schema, and generated an entire backoffice tool from it to let our business run smoothly.


### Schema

The adjusted schema looks like this:

```keel filename="schema.keel" {11}
model Product {
    fields {
        name Text
        description Text?
        imageUrl Text?
        stock StockItem[]
    }
    actions {
        get getProduct(id)
        list listProducts(stock.id)
        list listProductsWhereStock(stock.id)
        create createProduct() with (name, description?, imageUrl?, stock.quantity, stock.location.id)
    }
    @permission(
        expression: ctx.isAuthenticated,
        actions: [list, create, get]
    )
}

model StockItem {
    fields {
        product Product
        quantity Number
        location StockLocation
    }
    actions {
        create createStockItem() with (quantity, product.id, location.id)
        list listStockItems(product.id)
        update updateStockItem(id) with (quantity)
        delete deleteStockItem(id)
        get getStockItem(id)
    }
    @permission(
        expression: ctx.isAuthenticated,
        actions: [list, update, delete, get]
    )
}

model StockLocation {
    fields {
        name Text @unique
        items StockItem[]
    }
    actions {
        list listStockLocations()
        create createStockLocation() with (name)
        update updateStockLocation() with (name)
        delete deleteStockLocation(name)
        get getStockLocation(id)
    }
    @permission(
        expression: ctx.isAuthenticated,
        actions: [list, create, update, delete, get]
    )
}
```

## Next steps

This tutorial has shown you how to use Keel to build an end-to-end inventory management system. You can now use the generated tool to manage your stock. You can also use the generated GraphQL API to build a frontend application if you so choose.

Let's wrap up.
