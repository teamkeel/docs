# Setup

To begin, we will create a [new blank project](https://console.keel.so/start?type=blank) in your Keel Console. Once you deploy a schema, you will be able to access internal tools in the **Operate** section of the sidebar.

## Creating a schema

Before we use this section, let's create a schema with some models and fields.

### The `Product` model

Let's first create a `Product` model for which we want to manage stock. We'll give it a name, an optional description and an optional image URL.

```keel
model Product {
    fields {
        name Text
        description Text?
        imageUrl Text?
    }
}
```

### The `StockItem` model

Since we want to track how many products we have in stock, let's create a `StockItem` model with a quantity field and a [one-to-many](/models#one-to-many) relationship to the `Product` (a product can have many stock items).

```keel {6, 10-16}
model Product {
    fields {
        name Text
        description Text?
        imageUrl Text?
        stock StockItem[]
    }
}

model StockItem {
    fields {
        product Product
        quantity Number
    }
}
```

### The `StockLocation` model

And lastly, we want to know where the stock is located. Let's create a `StockLocation` with an identifiable name and a relationship to `StockItem` (a location can keep many items).

```keel {14, 18-23}
model Product {
    fields {
        name Text
        description Text?
        imageUrl Text?
        stock StockItem[]
    }
}

model StockItem {
    fields {
        product Product
        quantity Number
        location StockLocation
    }
}

model StockLocation {
    fields {
        name Text @unique
        items StockItem[]
    }
}
```

### Putting it all together

Now, we have the complete schema that drives our stock management application:

```keel filename="schema.keel"
model Product {
    fields {
        name Text
        description Text?
        imageUrl Text?
        stock StockItem[]
    }
}

model StockItem {
    fields {
        product Product
        quantity Number
        location StockLocation
    }
}

model StockLocation {
    fields {
        name Text @unique
        items StockItem[]
    }
}
```

## Previewing internal tools

With this schema, we can now deploy our project and start using the internal tools in the [Keel Console](https://console.keel.so). If you navigate to `All tools` in the Console per the screenshot above, you see that, apart from the built-in `Identity` tools, we haven't created any custom tools yet. Tools are generated from **actions** that you define in your schema, so let's create some in the next section.
