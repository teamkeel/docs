## User Model

To build out the User model for the application, we need to consider the following:

- A user should have a name and an email
- A user can be part of a team or not
- A user can create a document

To start we can describe the data for the User model with the following fields:

```keel
model User {

	fields {
        identity Identity @unique
        name Text
        email Text
        teams TeamMembership[]
        documents Document[]
    }
}
```

The above defines the `identity` field as `Identity` which carries the user [identity](https://docs.keel.so/identity) and act as a mechanism for [authentication](https://docs.keel.so/apis/json#authentication) We have also made the Identity unique with the @unique rule which makes sure that every user is unique.

The name and email of the user with a type of `Text` which is mandatory by default. We can make a field optional by using the `?` symbol.  In Keel, you can indicate a relationship between multiple models by referencing them as fields, in our case we are referencing the `TeamMembership` and `Document` model as a part of the User model since a user can belong to a team and also create a document.

Now that we’ve defined the data that belongs to the User model, we need to specify what [actions](https://docs.keel.so/actions) can be done on the User model and its respective permissions. In our Keel schema we can specify this using `actions` like so.

```keel {11-24}
model User {

  fields {
      identity Identity @unique
      name Text
      email Text
      teams TeamMembership[]
      documents Document[]
    }

  actions {
        get me() {
            @where(user.identity == ctx.identity)
        }
        list listUsers() {
            @where(user.identity == ctx.identity)
        }
        delete deleteUser(id)
        create createUser() with (name, email) {
            @set(user.identity = ctx.identity)
            @permission(expression: ctx.isAuthenticated)
        }
        update updateUser(id) with (name?, email?)
    }
}

```

Just below the model fields, we have defined the following actions that allow us perform [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) operations to the User model. All Keel models come with a built-in `id` property by default to serve as a means of reference to the model, hence why we are specifying it in some of the operations.

In the `createUser()` action, we have specified that a name and email  needs to be provided before a user can be created. We have also set the owner of the newly created record to be the identity of the logged in user and finally, we have provided a [permission](https://docs.keel.so/permissions) that this action can only be performed by an authenticated user. Permissions allow you define an authorization condition for an action to be carried out.

The `get me()` action will help us return the user’s identity in context just incase we need to pull the correct user details on the client-side.

  Action names don't carry any semantic relevance. The name of an action does not functional significance, what matters is the action type you use.
</Callout>

The `delete deleteUser()` action will help us delete a user account just incase we need to do that on the client-side.

The `update updateUser()` actions will help us update a user name or email.

Next, we need to set permissions for all the other actions in the model. We can do that by using [@permisson](https://docs.keel.so/permissions#permission-attribute) attribute to define this in the keel schema.

```keel {25-28}
model User {

  fields {
      identity Identity @unique
      name Text
      email Text
      teams TeamMembership[]
      documents Document[]
    }

    actions {
        get me() {
            @where(user.identity == ctx.identity)
        }
        list listUsers() {
            @where(user.identity == ctx.identity)
        }
        delete deleteUser(id)
        create createUser() with (name, email) {
            @set(user.identity = ctx.identity)
            @permission(expression: ctx.isAuthenticated)
        }
        update updateUser(id) with (name?, email?)
    }

    @permission(
        actions: [get, update, delete],
        expression: user.identity == ctx.identity
    )
}
```

In Keel, permissions are assigned to different action types by the action parameter of `@permissions`. How the permissions are implemented is defined by the expression parameter. Individual action permissions can be overridden by adding an `@permission` within the action definition, as demonstrated in createUser

So we’ve built our User model which is based on the application requirements we specified above.
