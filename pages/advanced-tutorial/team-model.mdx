# Team Model

To build out the Team model for the application, we need to consider that based on our application requirement, a user can be part of a team or not, a Team can create or own a document.  We can define the Team model like so:

```keel
model Team {
    fields {
        name Text
        description Text?
        members TeamMembership[]
        documents Document[]
    }

	actions {
        get getTeam(id)
        list listTeams() {
          @where(ctx.identity in team.members.user.identity)
        }
        delete deleteTeam(id)
        update updateTeam(id) with (name?, description?)
		 }

    @permission(
        actions: [get, list, update, delete],
        expression: ctx.identity in team.members.user.identity
    )
}
```

The model consists of fields `name` with a type of `Text` which holds the name of the team, `description` which is optional but holds the team’s description, the `members` and `document` fields holds the TeamMembership and documents models respectively.  We have also defined CRUD operations for the model `get`, `list`, `delete` and `update`.  We won’t be creating a team with this Model, instead we’ll be doing that in the `TeamMembership` model.

We have also set the `list` action to be carried out by a user with an existing Identity in the identity array hence the `@where{}` condition. The `@where{}` condition helps us filter through the permission rules filter the results of the action and make sure we’ve only pulling what belongs to the specified user.

Finally, for permissions, we defined all the actions in our model in an array with the `actions` and `expression` arguments respectively. We then use the `in` operator to check if the authenticated identity is in the array of identities with access to the model.
