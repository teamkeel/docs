# `in` Operator

Before we work on the `Team` model, letâ€™s talk a bit about Keelâ€™s permission system, specifically the `in` operator.

Permissions are crucial for any SAAS application and Keel caters for permissions out of the box.

Within Keel's [permission](https://docs.keel.so/permissions#many-to-many-relationships) system, the `in` operator helps in determining if a specific value exists within a collection. This operator is especially useful when defining complex permission rules that involve checking membership or existence within arrays or lists of values.

**Syntax:**

```keel {3}
model {
  @permission(
  expressions: value in collection
  )
}
```

**Parameters:**

- **`value`**: The specific value or entity you're checking for.
- **`collection`**: The collection (e.g., list of entities or values) you are searching within.

In Keel, the **`in`** operator is commonly used in permission expressions to verify if a certain entity or value is part of a collection. This is particularly handy when you want to check relationships or memberships in models.

**Example:**

Imagine you have a model representing teams and another model representing users. Each team has a list of user identities associated with it. If you want to check if a specific user's identity is part of a team, you can use the **`in`** operator:

```keel
@permission(
    actions: [get, list],
    expression: ctx.identity in team.users.identities
)
```

In this context, the permission will be granted if the current user's identity (**`ctx.identity`**) is found within the list of user identities associated with the team (**`team.users.identities`**).

  Please note that the `in` operator doesn't filter through permissions. When used in a permission, they just return a permission error if the response data contains anything the user canâ€™t access
