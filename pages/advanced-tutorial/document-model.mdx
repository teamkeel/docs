# Document Model

To build out the Document model for the application, we need to consider that based on our application requirement, a standalone user or user in a team can own a document.

We can define the Document model like this:

```keel
model Document {
    fields {
        title Text
        content Text
        user User
        team Team?
    }

    actions {
        get getDocument(id, user.id) {
            @permission(expression: ctx.identity == document.user.identity)
        }
        list listDocuments(user.id?, team.id?) {
            @where(document.user.identity == ctx.identity or ctx.identity in document.team.members.user.identity)
        }
        delete deleteDocument(id, user.id?, team.id?) {
            @permission(expression: document.user.identity == ctx.identity)
        }
        create createDocument() with (title, content, team.id?, user.id) {
            @permission(expression: ctx.isAuthenticated)
        }
        update updateDocument(id) with (title?, content?, team.id?, user.id?)
    }

    @permission(
        actions: [get, list, update, delete],
        expression: document.user.identity == ctx.identity or ctx.identity in document.team.members.user.identity
    )
}
```

The Document model fields `title` and `content` which are of type text and meant to hold the title and content of the document.

The field `user` directly reference the **`User`** model, this field establishes which specific user is tied to this document. Finally, An optional field, **`team`** provides a relationship to the **`Team`** model. It indicates that while a document can be a standalone entity associated with a user, it can also be tied to a specific team if the user that created it is in a team.

We have also specificied several [actions](https://docs.keel.so/actions) that can be carried out on the model and finally, for permission, weâ€™ve specified that these actions can only be carried out by the user identity that created the document or an identity that exists in the array of identities in a team.
