## Team Membership Model

The TeamMembership acts as a joiner between the Team and User models. It is as a join table for a [many to many relationship](https://docs.keel.so/models#many-to-many-relationships) between the User and Team models.

Following the same process we used to define our Team model, we need to define the model fields and actions.

```keel
model TeamMembership {
  fields {
        user User
        team Team
    }

	actions {
    create createTeam() with (team.name, team.description, user.id) {
      @permission(expression: ctx.isAuthenticated)
    }
  }
}
```

This model holds just two fields, the `User` and `Team` Models as it is meant to act as a Join table for those models. We’ve only specified a `createTeam()` action here that takes in the team’s name, description and user Id.

For permission, we’ve specified that this action can only be carried out by an authenticated user.
