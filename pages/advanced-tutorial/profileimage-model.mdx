# Profile Image Model

To build out the `ProfileImage` model for the application, we need to consider that based on our application requirement, a standalone user, user in a team, and a team can have a profile image.

We can define the ProfileImage model like this:

```keel
model ProfileImage {

    fields {
        path Text @unique
        user User?
        team Team?
    }

    actions {
        get getImage(id) {
            @permission(expression: ctx.identity == profileImage.user.identity)
        }
        list listImages() {
            @where(ctx.identity == profileImage.user.identity)
        }
        delete deleteImage(id)
        write uploadImageToCloudinary(UploadImageInput) returns (
            UploadImageResponse
        )
    }

    @permission(
        actions: [get, delete, list],
        expression: profileImage.user.identity == ctx.identity or ctx.identity in profileImage.team.members.user.identity
    )
}

message UploadImageInput {
    base64Image Text
    userId ID
}

message UploadImageResponse {
    path Text
}
```

In the model, we have specified a `path` field which takes in the image path/link, a user field which links to the `User` and optionally, the `Team` models respectively. We have defined the following operations for the model:

- `getImage` - This takes in the `id` and returns the image with the corresponding ID
- `listImages` - This returns all the images connected to the User or Team
- `deleteImage` - This takes in the image id and deletes the record from the database.

As you may have noticed, we are not using the `create` operation explicitly in the model, we are handling this with a function. Keel has support for executing operations with custom [functions](https://docs.keel.so/functions#custom-functions).
