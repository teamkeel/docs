## Prerequisites

To follow along with this tutorial, you should have the following:

- A GitHub account
- The [Keel CLI](https://docs.keel.so/cli)
- VS Code *and* the Keel [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=teamkeel.vscode-keel)
- A git client of any type (e.g command line, GitHub Desktop, VS Code Git)

## Setting up the Keel project

Before we start working on the project we need to a simple setup, we need to:

- Create the keel project on the keel [console](http://console.keel.xyz/) and clone the project to our machine
- Setup the VS Code extension
- Install the Keel CLI

To start, we need to create a new project on Keel by going to [console.keel.xyz](https://console.keel.xyz/start) and selecting a blank project which is the starting point for our SaaS app backend.

After creating the project, we need to clone the repo to our local machine and installing the VS Code extension.

## Cloning the repo
Once you reach the final step of the onboading you should see the git URL of your new repo. The next step is to clone the repo to your local machine and install the VS Code extension.

import { Tab, Tabs } from 'nextra-theme-docs'

<Tabs items={['Using git CLI', 'Using GitHub Desktop app']}>
  <Tab>
Copy the command directly from the final step of the project setup e.g.

```bash
git clone git@github.com/{yourUsername}/{projectName}
```
  </Tab>
    <Tab>
Click **add â†’ Clone Repository** and then select the newly created repo

## Installing VS Code extension

The Keel VS Code extension provides sytax highlighting and inline validation of Keel schema files. You can install it by going to the **Extensions** tab in VSCode and searching for [Keel](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=teamkeel.vscode-keel).

## Installing the Keel CLI
Next up, we need to install the keel CLI to our local machine, we can do this by running the following commands:

### Homebrew

The easiest way to install the Keel CLI is via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

```bash
$ brew tap teamkeel/homebrew-keel
$ brew install keel
```

You can check the installation by running `keel -v` or `keel --version` in your terminal.

```bash
$ keel -v
v0.366.0
```

  Docker is NOT required to generate functions, so if you don't have a docker setup you can still complete the tutorial.
