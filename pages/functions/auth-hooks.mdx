# Auth hooks

It can useful to provide custom functionality during the authentication flow.  For example, you may want to create a new `Account` model and associate it to the `Identity` which is created during registration.  Auth hooks are similar to action hooks and custom functions in that the implementation is done in TypeScript functions.

Keel currently provides the following two auth hooks.
 - `afterIdentityCreated`: executes when a new `Identity` model is created during authentication, and
 - `afterAuthentication`: executes after authentication completes, whether successful or not.

import { Callout } from "@core/callout";

<Callout type="info">
  Auth hook functions execute synchronously as part of the authentication flow.
</Callout>

To enable one or both of these hooks, specify the following in your `keelconfig.yaml` file:

```yaml
auth:
  hooks: [afterIdentityCreated, afterAuthentication]
```

Running `keel generate` will scaffold out the files for you in the `functions/auth/` path.

## Example

Let's demonstrate this with the `Account` example mentioned above. We want to automatically create a new `Account` model and associate it to the `Identity` created when the person logs in for the first time.

```keel
model Account {
    fields {
        name Text
        identity Identity @unique
    }
}
```

This will require implementing `afterIdentityCreated` as shown below.

```typescript
import { AfterIdentityCreated, models } from '@teamkeel/sdk';

// This synchronous hook will execute after successful authentication and a new identity record created
export default AfterIdentityCreated(async (ctx) => {
    const identity = ctx.identity!;
    await models.account.create({ name: identity.name ?? "", identityId: identity.id });
});
```
