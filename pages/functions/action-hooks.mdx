# Action hooks

Function hooks on actions can be created for the standard action types; `get`, `create`, `update`, `list`, and `delete`. To add hooks to a built-in action, we apply the `@function` attribute. To illustrate how to set up these functions, lets implement a simple `get` function.

```keel filename="schema.keel"
model Product {
  actions {
    get getProduct(id) @function
  }
}
```

If we then run `keel generate` a function file will be created for us which will look something like this.

```tsx filename="functions/getProduct.ts"
import { GetProduct } from "@teamkeel/sdk";

// To learn more about what you can do with hooks,
// visit https://docs.keel.so/functions
const hooks: GetProductHooks = {};

export default GetProduct(hooks);
```

The `@teamkeel/sdk` package is auto-generated based on your schema and contains wrapper functions for each of your schema-defined functions. These wrapper functions ensure that your code is correctly typed without having to explicitly declare types.

As you can see from this example all function hooks are optional, so even if no hooks are defined a function will still work correctly. We'll talk more about hooks in a bit, but for now they're fundamentally ways to do things around the lifecycle of the main `get` function which Keel still fully manages for you. For example, if we pass `id` in the inputs to the action, the function will query the database to find a product matching that `id` and return it.

### Hooks

Action function hooks allow you to **modify the default behaviour of a function**, for example you might want to add constraints to a query, run custom permission logic on the returned rows, create related data, or perform other side effects.

Each hook is described in detail below but this table shows which hooks are called for which action types.

| Hook          | **get** | **list** | **create** | **update** | **delete** |
| ------------- | ------- | -------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| `beforeQuery` | ✅      | ✅       | ❌         | ✅         | ✅         |
| `afterQuery`  | ✅      | ✅       | ❌         | ❌         | ❌         |
| `beforeWrite` | ❌      | ❌       | ✅         | ✅         | ✅         |
| `afterWrite`  | ❌      | ❌       | ✅         | ✅         | ✅         |

#### `beforeQuery`

The `beforeQuery` hook allows you to affect which records are being acted on. If this hook is not defined then a default query is executed based on the inputs your action accepts. This hook is passed the default query and may return a modified version of it, a new query, or database record(s).

##### Arguments

- `ctx` - a context object which contains things like the authenticated Identity, environment variables and secrets, and request headers
- `inputs` - the inputs provided by the caller of your function
- `query` - the default query that will be run

##### Example: extending the default query

By default, a query is generated based on the inputs your action accepts. For example, given the following schema:

```keel
model Film {
  fields {
    title Text
  }
  actions {
    listFilms(title) @function
  }
}
```

And an implementation of `listFilms` that looks like this:

```typescript filename="functions/listFilms.ts"
import { ListFilms } from "@teamkeel/sdk";

export default ListFilms({
  beforeQuery(ctx, inputs, query) {
    return query.where({
      title: {
        endsWith: "phantom menace",
      },
    });
  },
});
```

The `listFilms` action will now always filter for records whose title ends with "phantom menace". If you then called the `listFilms` action with the following request:

```json
{
  "where": {
    "title": {
      "startsWith": "star wars"
    }
  }
}
```

You would now get back films whose title starts with "star wars" **and** ends with "phantom menace". This example shows how you can _extend_ the default query for all actions that this hook is valid for.

##### Example: custom query

If you don't want the default query behaviour at all then you can return a new query object. To illustrate this the following schema defines a `get` function called `latestRelease`:

```keel
model Film {
  fields {
    director Text
    releaseDate Date
  }
  actions {
    get latestRelease(director) @function
  }
}
```

If this action wasn't marked as a `@function` then you would get a validation error as `director` is not a unique field, but as this is a function we can provide a custom implementation.

```typescript filename="functions/latestRelease.ts"
import { LatestRelease, models } from "@teamkeel/sdk";

export default LatestRelease({
  async beforeQuery(ctx, inputs) {
    // Find the most recent film by the provided director
    const films = await models.film.findMany({
      where: {
        director: {
          equals: inputs.director,
        },
      },
      limit: 1,
      orderBy: {
        releaseDate: 'desc',
      },
    });

    // If no films then return null
    // Note: get actions should return a record or null
    if (films.length) === 0 {
      return null;
    }

    // Return the first result
    return films[0];
  },
});
```

#### `afterQuery`

The `afterQuery` hook allows you to modify the response, perform custom permission checks, or perform side effects using the data returned from the query.

##### Arguments

- `ctx` - a context object which contains things like the authenticated Identity, environment variables and secrets, and request headers
- `inputs` - the inputs provided by the caller of your function
- `data` - the data that was retrieved from the database

##### Example: modify the response

The following example shows how `afterQuery` could modify the data returned from the function.

```typescript filename="functions/listPreviewProducts.ts"
import { ListPreviewProducts } from "@teamkeel/sdk";

export default ListPreviewProducts({
  async afterQuery(ctx, inputs, products) {
    return products.map((p) => ({
      ...p,
      // truncate the title to 10 characters if not authenticated
      title: ctx.isAuthenticated ? p.title : `${p.title.slice(0, 10)}...`,
    }));
  },
});
```

##### Example: custom permissions check

The `afterQuery` hook could also be used to add a custom permissions check, for example:

```typescript filename="functions/listProducts.ts"
import { ListProducts, permissions } from "@teamkeel/sdk";

export default ListProducts({
  async afterQuery(ctx, inputs, products) {
    const hasUnpublishedProducts = products.some((p) => !p.isPublished);

    if (hasUnpublishedProducts && !ctx.isAuthenticated) {
      // deny the request if any of the products returned are not published
      // and the request is not authenticated
      // permissions.deny() will throw an error and stop execution.
      permissions.deny();
    }

    // otherwise, just return the products in the response.
    return products;
  },
});
```

#### `beforeWrite`

The `beforeWrite` hook allows you perform side-effects or permission checks for `create`, `update`, and `delete` function. For `create` and `update` functions this hook can also be used to modify the values that will be written to the database.

##### Arguments

The arguments to `beforeWrite` are slightly different depending on the action type.

**create**

- `ctx` - a context object which contains things like the authenticated Identity, environment variables and secrets, and request headers
- `inputs` - the inputs provided by the caller of your function
- `values` - the values that will be written to the database

**update**

- `ctx` - a context object which contains things like the authenticated Identity, environment variables and secrets, and request headers
- `inputs` - the inputs provided by the caller of your function
- `values` - the _new_ values that will be written to the database
- `record` - the _existing_ record that is going to be updated

**delete**

- `ctx` - a context object which contains things like the authenticated Identity, environment variables and secrets, and request headers
- `inputs` - the inputs provided by the caller of your function
- `record` - the record that is going to be deleted

##### Example: mutate write values

The following example shows how the `beforeWrite` hook can be used to mutate the values being written to the database. Here a `summary` field is computed based on the title and the first 100 characters of the description.

```typescript filename="functions/createProduct.ts"
import { CreateProduct } from "@teamkeel/sdk";

export default CreateProduct({
  async beforeWrite(ctx, inputs, values) {
    let desc = inputs.description;
    if (desc.length > 100) {
      desc = desc.substring(0, 97) + "...";
    }
    return {
      ...values,
      summary: `${inputs.title} - ${desc}`,
    };
  },
});
```

##### Example: update based on existing values

When using this hook in an `update` function the fourth argument to the hook is the _existing_ record. The following example shows how you can use that record to update the values that will be used for the update.

```typescript filename="functions/incrementCounter.ts"
import { IncrementCounter } from "@teamkeel/sdk";

export default IncrementCounter({
  async beforeWrite(ctx, inputs, values, record) {
    return {
      ...values,
      count: record.count + inputs.value,
    };
  },
});
```

#### `afterWrite`

The `afterWrite` hook allows you to perform side effects after the record has been written to the database for `create` and `update` and after the record has been deleted for `delete`. Common use cases include creating other models and performing custom permission checks.

For `create` and `update` this hook can return a modified version of the record that was created or updated. As with `afterQuery` this only affects the data returned from the API, not the data in the database.

import { Callout } from "@core/callout";

<Callout type="info"  >
  Although the `afterWrite` hook can be used to perform side-effects after a
  write, in many cases it will be better to use an [event](/events). The key
  difference is that the `afterWrite` hook happens as part of your action and so
  will affect the response time of your action, whereas an event happens
  _asynchronously_.
</Callout>

##### Arguments

- `ctx` - a context object which contains things like the authenticated Identity, environment variables and secrets, and request headers
- `inputs` - the inputs provided by the caller of your function
- `data` - the record that that was created/updated/deleted

##### Example: creating additional records

The following example shows how you can create additional records in the database in an `afterWrite` hook.

```typescript filename="functions/createProduct.ts"
import { CreateProduct, models } from "@teamkeel/sdk";

export default CreateProduct({
  async afterWrite(ctx, inputs, data) {
    await models.productReviews.create({
      productId: data.id,
      rating: 10,
      content: "We love it, and that's not just because we made it.",
    });
  },
});
```

##### Example: posting an update to Slack

In a `delete` function the third argument to the `afterWrite` hook is the record that was deleted. The following example shows how you could post a message to Slack whenever a product is deleted.

```typescript filename="functions/createProduct.ts"
import { DeleteProduct, models } from "@teamkeel/sdk";
import { sendSlackMessage } from "../lib/slack";

export default DeleteProduct({
  async afterWrite(ctx, inputs, data) {
    await sendSlackMessage(
      "#products",
      `${data.title} (${data.id}) has been deleted!`
    );
  },
});
```

### Named inputs

Given the following schema, we have a `get` function called `latestRelease` that takes a `director` input.

```keel filename="schema.keel"
model Film {
  fields {
    director Text
    releaseDate Date
  }
  actions {
    get latestRelease(director) @function
  }
}
```

In this case, `director` is a field on the model. Sometimes, we may need to pass inputs to functions that are not fields on the model. For example, we may want to pass a `yearLimit` input to this `get` function to find the latest release *within* a given year for directors who have released multiple films in that year.

To do this, we can add a specific input to this function that the function will receive that is not a field on the model. This is called a *named input*. We can do this like so.

```keel filename="schema.keel" {7}
model Film {
  fields {
    director Text
    releaseDate Date
  }
  actions {
    get latestRelease(director, yearLimit: Number) @function
  }
}
```

Now, the hooks for this function will receive a property called `yearLimit` on their `inputs` argument that can be used for further filtering.

```typescript filename="functions/latestRelease.ts" {11,12}
import { ListFilms } from "@teamkeel/sdk";

export default ListFilms({
  async beforeQuery(ctx, inputs, query) {
    const allFilms = await query.where({
      director: {
        endsWith: "Waititi",
      },
    });

    // filter the films by yearLimit
    const films = allFilms.filter((f) => f.releaseDate.getFullYear() <= inputs.yearLimit);

    return films;
  },
});
```

We use `inputs.yearLimit` to filter the films by the year limit provided by the caller of the function even though `yearLimit` is not necessarily a field on the model. This is the value of named inputs.
