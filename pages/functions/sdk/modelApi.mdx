# The Model API

The `@teamkeel/sdk` package is generated based on your schema and contains type-safe APIs for interacting with your models. These APIs are all available on the exported `models` object.

```jsx
import { models } from "@teamkeel/sdk";
```

Given the following Keel schema:

```graphql
model Post {
	fields {
     title Text
  }

  actions {
    write createPost()
  }
}

model Author {
  fields {
     name Text
  }
}
```

`models.post` and `models.author` will be available.

## Creating a record

`.create()` receives a single parameter:

- `params` - object representing all of the data you would like to insert. This must include all required fields on the model.

Fields that have a `@default` value in the schema will have their default values populated if no value is provided.

For `@unique` fields, inserted data will be checked for uniqueness.

```tsx
import { models } from "@teamkeel/sdk";

const post = await models.post.create({
  title: "a post about star wars",
});

console.log(post.title); // => a post about star wars
```

The return type is `Promise<Model>`

## Updating a record

`.update()` receives two parameters:

- `where` - the query conditions to lookup records by.
- `values` - the set of changes you want to update the record(s) with.

For `@unique` fields, updated data will be checked for uniqueness.

```tsx
import { models } from "@teamkeel/sdk";

const where = {
  id: "123",
};

const values = {
  title: "a post about star wars",
};

const post = await models.post.update(where, values);

console.log(`Updated ${post.id}'s title`);
```

The return type is `Promise<Model>`

## Deleting a record

`.delete()` receives a single parameter:

- `where` - the conditions applied to the database query that will determine which records will be deleted

```jsx
import { models } from "@teamkeel/sdk";

const deletedId = models.post.delete({
  id: "123",
});
```

## Reading a single record

`.findOne()` receives a single parameter:

- `where` - an object where the keys are any unique field on a model and the values are the unique values you want to look up by

```jsx
import { models } from "@teamkeel/sdk";

const post = await models.post.findOne({
  id: "abc",
});
```

The return type is `Promise<Model | null>`

## Reading multiple records

`.findMany` receives a single parameter:

- `params` - Object of type `FindManyParams`

### FindManyParams

Consists of four top level properties:

- `limit` (`number`) - the number of rows to limit the result set by
  ```tsx
  import { models } from "@teamkeel/sdk";

  const results = await models.post.findMany({
    limit: 5,
  });
  ```
- `offset` (`number`) - the number of rows to offset by. Usually combined with `limit` and `orderBy` to return individual pages of data.
  ```tsx
  import { models } from "@teamkeel/sdk";

  const results = await models.post.findMany({
    limit: 10,
    offset: 2,
    orderBy: {
      title: "asc",
    },
  });
  ```
- `where` (`Where`) - an object where the keys are one of the fields on the model and the values are objects conforming to the `WhereConditions` type. See the `WhereConditions` reference for a full table of the available options for different field types below.
  ```tsx
  import { models } from "@teamkeel/sdk";

  const postsBeginningWithA = await models.post.findMany({
    {
      where: {
        title: {
          startsWith: 'a'
        }
      }
    }
  });
  ```
- `orderBy` (`OrderBy`) - an object used to define the sort order of the results returned from the database. The object must contain **_one_** property where the key is a known field name on the model, and the value must either be `asc`, `desc`.
  ```tsx
  import { models } from "@teamkeel/sdk";

  const orderedByTitle = await models.post.findMany(
    orderBy: {
      title: 'asc'
    }
  );
  ```

### WhereConditions

The `WhereConditions` type can be used with the `findMany` method to filter by a range of different operators:

| Operator Name       | Field Types                     | Description                                                              | Usage                                                |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| startsWith          | Text                            | Match values beginning with the search value                             | `{ title: { startsWith: 'abc' }}`                    |
| endsWith            | Text                            | Match values ending with the search value                                | `{ title: { endsWith: 'xyz' }}`                      |
| oneOf               | Text                            | Match values against an array of possible values                         | `{ title: { oneOf: ['apple', 'orange'] }}`           |
| contains            | Text                            | Match values against a partial match within a string                     | `{ title: { contains: 'apple' } }`                   |
| notEquals           | Text, Number, Boolean           | Find values where not matching search value                              | `{ title: { notEquals: 'apple' }}`                   |
| equals              | Text, Number, Date, ID, Boolean | Find values matching the search value                                    | `{ title: { equals: 'orange' }}`                     |
| greaterThan         | Number                          | Find values where the value is greater than the search value             | `{ rating: { greaterThan: 5 }}`                      |
| greaterThanOrEquals | Number                          | Find values where the value is greater than or equal to the search value | `{ rating: { greaterThanOrEquals: 5 }}`              |
| lessThan            | Number                          | Find values where the value is less than the search value                | `{ rating: { lessThan: 5 }}`                         |
| lessThanOrEquals    | Number                          | Find values where the value is less than or equal to the search value    | `{ rating: { lessThanOrEquals: 5 }}`                 |
| before              | Date                            | Find values where the date is before the search date                     | `{ createdAt: { before: new Date(2020, 1, 1) }}`     |
| onOrBefore          | Date                            | Find values where the date is equal to or before the search date         | `{ createdAt: { onOrBefore: new Date(2020, 1, 1) }}` |
| after               | Date                            | Find values where the date is after the search date                      | `{ createdAt: { after: new Date(2020, 1, 1) }}`      |
| onOrAfter           | Date                            | Find values where the date is equal to or after the search date          | `{ createdAt: { onOrAfter: new Date(2020, 1, 1) }}`  |

## Nested Create / Update

import { Callout } from "nextra/components";

<Callout type="warning">
  The Model API doesn't currently support creating or updating nested relations, but will in the near future.
</Callout>

Until then, you can create related models yourself using the Model API:

```typescript filename="functions/createPost.ts"
import { CreatePost, models } from '@teamkeel/sdk';

export default CreatePost({
  beforeWrite: async (ctx, inputs) => {
    const {
      author: { name }
    } = inputs;

    // create the new author prior to creating the post
    const author = await models.author.create({ name });

    return {
      ...inputs,
      authorId: author.id
    }
  }
});
```
