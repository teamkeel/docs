# Database API

<Callout type="info">
  Keel provides an elegant, type-safe **[Model API](/functions/sdk/modelApi)** for interacting with your models; reach for that first before considering using the low level database API.
</Callout>

If you need to write more complex queries where you directly control the SQL being generated, we expose an instance of the type-safe JavaScript / TypeScript query builder [Kysely](https://kysely.dev/) via our SDK package:

```tsx
import { GetPost, useDatabase } from "@teamkeel/sdk";

export default GetPost(async (ctx, inputs) => {
  const db = useDatabase();

  const post = await db
    .selectFrom("post")
    .selectAll()
    .where("createdAt", ">=", new Date(2020, 1, 1))
    .executeTakeFirstOrThrow();

  return post;
});
```

import { Callout } from "nextra/components";

<Callout>
  Column and table names are represented in snake_case at the database level,
  but lowerCamelCase casing should be used when referencing column and table
  names when building queries (such as `createdAt` above), as Kysely will
  automatically convert the casing from the former to the latter.
</Callout>
