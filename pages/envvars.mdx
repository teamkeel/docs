# Environment Variables

With Keel you can have as many environments as you need and often different environments need different configuration. This is where **environment variables** are useful.

import { Callout } from "@core/callout"

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Do not use environment variables for sensitive values such as API keys. For these kinds of values use [secrets](/secrets).
</Callout>

## Defining Environment Variables

Environment variables are defined in a `keelconfig.yaml` file which should be in the root of your project.

```yaml filename="keelconfig.yaml"
environment:
  - name: MY_ENV_VAR
    value: "my staging value"
  - name: MY_ENV_VAR
    value: "my production value"
```

Use a `keelconfig.staging.yaml` and `keelconfig.production.yaml` to configure your hosted environments.  You can read more about this [here](/keelconfig).

### Names

Environment variables must be named in UPPER_SNAKE_SNAKE and cannot start with any of the following values:

* `KEEL_`
* `AWS_`
* `OTEL_`

### Values

Environment variables are always strings. You don't have to provide a value for every environment type.

## Using Environment Variables

There are two ways to use environment variables in Keel. You can do this from your Keel schema or from your function code.

### From a Keel schema

Environments variables can be accessed with `ctx.env.ENV_VAR_NAME` from within any expression in your schema.

```keel {8} filename="schema.keel"
model Person {
    fields {
        name Text
    }

    actions {
        create createPerson() with () {
            @set(person.name = ctx.env.PERSON_NAME)
        }
    }
}
```

### From a function

You can access your environments variables in a **type-safe way** through the `ctx` argument that is passed to your functions, for example `ctx.env.MY_ENV_VAR`.

```tsx filename="functions/myFunction.ts"
export default MyFunction(async (ctx, inputs) => {
  // "some-vale"
  ctx.env.MY_ENV_VAR

  // TypeScript will catch this with the error:
  // ts(2339) Property 'FOO' does not exist on type 'Environment'.
  ctx.env.FOO
});
```
