# OIDC Token Authentication

With OIDC Token authentication, we are able to securely authenticate a user with just an ID token from a third-party provider.  With this flow we do not perform the authentication steps with the provider.  For example, if you're authenticating with Google, then you'll most like implement the [Authorization Code Flow](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/javascript-implicit-flow) to sign the user in.  You will need to build this into your application. 

These are the general steps:

 1. Perform the relevant authentication flow with your provider
 2. Extract `id_token` from the successful auth respoonse
 3. Perform “token exchange” with our `/auth/token` endpoint to authenticate
 4. Use access and refresh tokens to query your Keel API

  An ID token is an artifact that proves that a user has been authenticated. It was introduced by OpenID Connect (OIDC), an open standard for authentication used by many identity providers such as Google, Facebook, and, Auth0.
</Callout>

For OpenID Connect-compatible providers, the ID token will normally be returned from the provider's token endpoint.  For example, this is the response from Auth0's token endpoint after successfully authenticating:

```json
{
	"access_token": "{{access_token}}",
	"id_token": "{{id_token}}",
	"scope": "openid profile email address phone",
	"expires_in": 86400,
	"token_type": "Bearer"
}
```

If an ID token is not returned with your providers token endpoint, then you might need to request it by providing the scope value `openid`.

Once you have obtained the ID token, you can use it to gain access to your Keel app.  

import { Tab, Tabs } from ‘nextra-theme-docs’
<Tabs items={[‘cURL’, ‘Node.JS’, ‘GraphQL query’]}>
  <Tab>
```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url ‘https://{yourDomain}/auth/token’ \
  --header ‘content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded’ \
  --data grant_type=token_exchange \
  --data subject_token=ID_TOKEN
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
```js
var axios = require(“axios”).default;
var options = {
  method: ‘POST’,
  url: ‘https://{yourDomain}/oauth/token’,
  headers: {‘content-type’: ‘application/x-www-form-urlencoded’},
  data: new URLSearchParams({
    grant_type: ‘client_credentials’,
    client_id: ‘YOUR_CLIENT_ID’,
    client_secret: ‘YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET’,
    audience: ‘YOUR_API_IDENTIFIER’
  })
};
axios.request(options).then(function (response) {
  console.log(response.data);
}).catch(function (error) {
  console.error(error);
});
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

If you are successfully authenticated, the token endpoint has a standard `application/json` response.

```json filename=“HTTP 200"
{
  “access_token”: “eyJhbGciOiJSUzI...“,
  “token_type”: “Bearer”,
  “expires_in”: 86400,
  “refresh_token”: “TvngQKPYcCXsuCp...”
}
```
