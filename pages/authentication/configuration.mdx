# Configuration

All configuration for authentication your Keel application is done in the `keelconfig.yaml` file.

## Configuring Tokens

You can configure your tokens like so:

```yaml
auth:
  tokens:
    # Lifespan of the access token in seconds. Default is 24 hours.
    accessTokenExpiry: 3600
    # Lifespan of the refresh token in seconds. Default is 3 months.
    refreshTokenExpiry: 604800
    # Enable refresh token rotation. Default is true.
    refreshTokenRotationEnabled: true
```

It's recommended to keep the lifespan of an access token extremely short, since if they're stolen they can be used to access your application as a specific user. Refresh tokens are used to acquire new access tokens, and can live longer.

## Redirect URL

For Single Sign-On, make sure to configure the `redirectUrl`.  Users will be sent here after the `auth/authorize/{provider}` flow has successfully completed. An auth code will be provided in the query parameter `code`, which can then be used at the token endpoint to acquire an access and refresh token. We go into more detail about this on the [Single Sign-On page](/authentication/flows/sso).

## Providers

Various providers can be configured.  Depending on the `type` various other fields may be required.  

| Parameter Name | Description                                |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `type`     | The type of provider |
| `name`  | The unique name you give to this provider       |
| `clientId`  | The client ID given to you by your provider    |

### Types of Providers

We support `google`, `facebook`, and `gitlab` out-of-the-box. See [the providers page](/authentication/providers) for more.

You can also configure your own custom OpenId Connect (`oidc`) provider type. Read on for more.

### Out of the Box Providers

No additional fields need to be provided.

```yaml
auth:
  providers:
    - type: google
      name: google_client
      clientId: hfjuwaa3a2983h1hfsdf
```

### Custom OpenID Connect Provider

| Parameter Name | Description                                |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `issuerUrl`     | The provider's issuer URL used for discovery purposes |

```yaml
auth:
  providers:
    # Custom OIDC
    - type: oidc
      name: Baidu
      issuerUrl: https://dev-skhlutl45lbqkvhv.us.auth0.com
      clientId: kasj28fnq09ak
```

### Client Secret Configuration

This is only necessary for the [Single Sign-On](/authentication/flows/sso) flow.

The name of the secret has the format `AUTH_PROVIDER_SECRET_{name}` where `{name}` is the UPPER_SNAKE_CASED name of the provider as configured in your `keelconfig.yaml` file. See the Single Sign-On page for more.
