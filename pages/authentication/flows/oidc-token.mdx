# OIDC Token Authentication

With OIDC Token authentication, we are able to securely authenticate a user with just an ID token from a third-party provider.  With this flow you would have already performed the necessary authentication steps with the provider.  For example, if you're authenticating with Google, then you'll most likely have implemented the [Authorization Code Flow](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/javascript-implicit-flow) to sign the user in. 

These are the general steps:

 1. Perform the relevant authentication flow with your provider
 2. Extract the `id_token` from the successful token response
 3. Perform "token exchange" with our `/auth/token` endpoint to authenticate
 4. Use the access and refresh tokens to query your Keel API


import { Callout } from "nextra/components";

  An ID token is an artifact that proves that a user has been authenticated. It was introduced by OpenID Connect (OIDC), an open standard for authentication used by many identity providers such as Google, Facebook, and, Auth0.
</Callout>

For OpenID Connect-compatible providers, the ID token will normally be returned from the provider's token endpoint.  For example, this is the response from Auth0's token endpoint after successfully authenticating:

```json
{
	"access_token": "{{provider_access_token}}",
	"id_token": "{{provider_id_token}}",
	"scope": "openid profile email address phone",
	"expires_in": 86400,
	"token_type": "Bearer"
}
```

If an ID token is not returned with your providers token endpoint, then you might need to request it by providing the scope value `openid`.

Once you have obtained the ID token, you can use it to gain access to your Keel app.  

import { Tab, Tabs } from "nextra-theme-docs";

<Tabs items={['cURL', 'Node.JS']}>
  <Tab>
```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://{yourDomain}/auth/token’ \
  --header 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded’ \
  --data grant_type=token_exchange \
  --data subject_token={{provider_id_token}}
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
```js
var axios = require("axios").default;
var options = {
  method: 'POST’,
  url: 'https://{yourDomain}/auth/token’,
  headers: {'content-type’: 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded’},
  data: new URLSearchParams({
    grant_type: 'token_exchange,
    subject_token: '{{provider_id_token}}'
  })
};

axios.request(options).then(function (response) {
  console.log(response.data);
}).catch(function (error) {
  console.error(error);
});
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

If you are successfully authenticated, the token endpoint has a standard `application/json` response.

```json filename="HTTP 200"
{
  "access_token": "{{keel_access_token}}",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 86400,
  "refresh_token": "{{keel_id_token}}"
}
```
