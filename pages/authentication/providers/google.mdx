# Google

The Google provider can be used with either [OIDC Token](/authentication/flows/oidc-token) or [SSO Login](/authentication/flows/sso-login) authentication.

## Client Setup

In order to use Google as an authentication provider, you need to first register an OAuth 2.0 client.

 1. Go to the [Google Cloud Platform Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
 2. From the projects list, select a project or create a new one.
 3. If the APIs & services page isn't already open, open the console left side menu and select APIs & services.
 4. On the left, click Credentials.
 5. Click New Credentials, then select OAuth client ID.

 6. Select OAuth client ID, and then select the application type in the dropdown list. 
 7. Now you can give the client a name.
 8. If you are using [SSO Login](/authentication/flows/sso-login), then make sure to include the Callback URL.

 9. If this is your first time creating a client ID, you can also configure your consent screen by clicking Consent Screen. (The following procedure explains how to set up the Consent screen.) You won't be prompted to configure the consent screen after you do it the first time.
 10. Click Create client ID

 Now that you've got a Client ID and a Client Secret, you can use them to configure the Google provider in Keel.

## Using your Credentials in Keel

The following `keelconfig.yaml` entry will enable Google authentication on your Keel app:

```yaml filename="keelconfig.yaml"
auth:
  providers:
    - type: google
      name: 'Google Example Client'
      clientId: {{clientId}}
```
