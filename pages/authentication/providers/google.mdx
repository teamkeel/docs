# Google

The Google provider can be used with either [OIDC Token](/authentication/oidc-token-auth) or [SSO Login](/authentication/sso-login-auth) authentication.

## `keelconfig.yaml` configuration

The following `keelconfig.yaml` entry will enable Google authentication on your Keel app:

```yaml filename="keelconfig.yaml"
auth:
  providers:
    - type: google
      name: 'Google Example Client'
      clientId: {{clientId}}
```

In order to use Google as an authenticaiton provider, you need to create a OAuth 2.0 client.

 1. Go to the [Google Cloud Platform Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
 2. From the projects list, select a project or create a new one.
 3. If the APIs & services page isn't already open, open the console left side menu and select APIs & services.
 4. On the left, click Credentials.
 5. Click New Credentials, then select OAuth client ID.

 6. Select OAuth client ID, and then select the application type in the dropdown list. 
 7. Now you can give the client a name.
 8. If you are using [SSO Login](/authentication/sso-login-auth), then make sure to include the Callback URL. TODO link and page

 8. Click Create client ID
